					<p>A functional quadcopter system powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, implementing a full
						PID-based flight controller from scratch to enable stable hover on a custom gimbal stand was built. Our
						goal was to design a hands-on, educational drone platform that could be integrated into ECE and
						MAE course curricula, allowing students to work directly with embedded systems, control theory,
						and dynamics. Starting from a partially developed hardware prototype and minimal software, we
						developed our own PID control logic, tuned it through extensive testing, and integrated
						radio-based throttle control. This project not only demonstrated our understanding of embedded
						flight control, but also laid the groundwork for a low-cost, reproducible drone platform for
						future student use.</p>

					<h3>High Level Design and Inspiration</h3>
					<h4>Rationale and sources of your project idea</h4>
					<p>
						Bryan, Martin and Nikolai enjoy drones and quadcopters, we thought it would be a neat idea to develop
						a somewhat functioning flight controller to control the drone with an onboard IMU for
						orientation data, an external remote to set the throttle position, and an electronic speed
						controller (ESC). <br />
						<br />
						Nikolai is a part of the Motion Studio "Drone Squad" advised by Dr. Beatriz Asfora which was
						involved in the creating of this final project idea. Out of the Drone Squad there was already a
						prototype developed by Deemo Chen with a PCB integrating an IMU and Pi Pico along with a
						skeleton of code on how to control each PWM ESC channel. <br />
						<br />
						The long-term objective of this project is to support the integration of these Pico-based drones
						made from 3D printed components into ECE and MAE courses. For instance, these drones could be
						integrated in the ECE microcontrollers curriculum and the students could work on code
						developing/tuning a PID controller. Or, for a MAE dynamics course, the students could use these
						drones for dynamics modelling.
					</p>

					<h4>Background Math</h4>

					<p>The effects of a <i>P</i>, <i>I</i> and <i>D</i> terms are well known. If we think of controlling
						the mass in a spring-mass-damped system, the <i>P</i> term acts like increasing the stiffness
						of the spring, whereas the <i>D</i> term effectively adds damping to the system. An <i>I</i>
						term in general achieves the desirable property of having zero steady state.
						<br />
						<br />
						Even though our system is not a spring-mass-damped system, we can still keep in mind the above
						intuitive properties of each of the three terms of a PID controller.

						We ended up using the same set of three <i>P</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>D</i> coefficients for
						controlling the pitch and the roll angle, and a different set of three <i>P</i>, <i>I</i>,
						<i>D</i> coefficients for the yaw angle. Therefore, <i>6</i> in total.
						<br />
						<br />
						We did not do any modelling of the drone ("plant") dynamics, and did the tuning by trial and
						error. With more time, we would obtain the equations of motion and linearize about the desired
						hover position. We would get a linear set of equations, keeping in mind that we should include a
						model of noise in the measurements obtained from the IMU. There would be two standard approaches
						we could have taken: either design the controller using the state-space approach, or frequency
						design. Preceeding each of these two approaches, we would first have to obtain the dynamical
						equations of motion from Newton's second law and then linearize them about the desired hover
						position.
						<br />
						<br />
						Getting the dynamical equations of motion would have been non-trivial for several reasons, and
						was not achievable in the allocated time for this project. First of all, we would have to obtain
						the center of mass and tensor of inertia with respect to the gimbal, treating the drone as a
						rigid body. This could have been obtained from a CAD assembly, but only approximately - due to
						the geometry of <i>3D</i> printed layers, see linked files for the individual parts.
						(Furthermore, the chip itself, the IMU, the wiring, the battery would all change these
						quantities, and indicate why it would have been really hard to obtain at least a reasonable
						model of the dynamics.) Second of all, the friction at the gimbal on the frame of the drone and
						the pull of the cables would have to be modelled. The thrust of the propellers in terms of the
						duty cycle of our PWM control signal supplied to the motors would be obtained from the
						documentation of the propeller's manufacturer. We should keep in mind that the gimbal support
						was not located under the center of mass.

					<h4>Logical Structure</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Initialize radio and sensors</li>
						<li>Calibrate ESCs and Gyro</li>
						<li>Initialize serial PID tuning interface</li>
						<li>Wait for arm signal from controller
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Erase all stored PID values — effectively reset controls</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Spin up motors to minimum throttle and begin executing PID loop</li>
						<li>Continue executing PID loop until disarm</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Hardware Software Tradeoffs</h4>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>PID loop speed:</strong> Since the drone is a complicated, unstable system with
							4&nbsp;motors and 6&nbsp;degrees of freedom, it is vital to have a fast control loop. From
							our testing (and Lab&nbsp;3) we found a rate of 1&nbsp;kHz works well. Unlike
							Lab&nbsp;3, we must compute PID terms for three axes—pitch, roll, and yaw. Pitch and roll
							share the same PID parameters, while yaw uses different parameters discussed later in this
							section.</li>

						<li><strong>Pico&nbsp;W:</strong> The Pico&nbsp;W provides head-room for future wireless
							features. A possible enhancement is a web-based PID-tuning interface where students adjust
							sliders and watch live gyro and controller outputs to evaluate PID performance or drone
							models.</li>

						<li><strong>Controlling 4&nbsp;Motors:</strong> PWM signals must be calculated for all four
							motors (versus a single motor in Lab&nbsp;3), which greatly increases compute time.
							Combining this with multi-axis control means roughly
							6&nbsp;(PID&nbsp;terms) × 3&nbsp;(axes) × 4&nbsp;(motors) = 64 × more
							computation than Lab&nbsp;3. Furthermore, changing any motor speed induces torque that
							affects the yaw axis—covered in the next point.
						</li>

						<li><strong>Yaw Compensation:</strong> Physical coupling between axes required different PID
							weights for yaw than for pitch/roll. In practice the yaw <em>D</em> term was reduced
							significantly so yaw corrections would not fight the other axes and cause unstable
							oscillations.</li>

						<li><strong>Long-Term Gyro Drift:</strong> Drift can affect behavior over minutes or hours.
							Battery life is only ~ 5&nbsp;minutes, so this is minor; nevertheless, the gyro recalibrates
							each time a battery is plugged in, ensuring reliable short-term attitude estimates.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Program Details</h4>
					<p>The skeleton of code we started from was unnecessarily complicated, so our biggest challenge was
						discovering how the actual control algorithms and peripheral interfaces were implemented. The
						code for the radio interface was reverse-engineered based on the serial string received from the
						controller. Although that was straightforward, it was far less straightforward to implement
						pitch, roll, and yaw control from the controller to the rest of the code. Hence, we stuck with
						throttle and arm only. From there, we scrapped his PID control as it was unfinished and did not
						work and wrote our own. This has its own challenges as we are implementing it on a quadcopter
						with four motors. One really important thing that we realized early was that the physical model
						for how yaw is controlled is extremely different from how pitch and roll is controlled. This
						means we needed separate coefficients for yaw PID and pitch/roll PID. To implement this, we
						simply compute the PID values, then apply the coefficients separately in the motor mixing
						calculations. </p>

					<h3>PID Tuning</h3>
			
					<p>
						Tuning the PIDs on a quadcopter you designed and built from scratch is challenging—
						there is little external guidance, so progress hinges on a solid grasp of both the
						physics and the firmware. The hardest part was diagnosing whether instabilities
						originated from gyro noise or from interactions between pitch/roll corrections and
						yaw compensation. Any motor adjustment changes yaw torque, so one axis can easily
						induce errors in another. After experimentation we established a non-oscillatory
						starting point for all three axes.
					</p>
			
					<h4>Table 3: Initial PID Values</h4>

					<p>
						Continued tuning produced PID values that reacted briskly to disturbances, held level
						well, and coped with center-of-gravity shifts. The main difficulty was choosing gains
						that worked across the full throttle range without amplifying vibration-induced noise.
						A persistent, slowly varying angle error—initially mistaken for steady-state error—was
						traced to drift in the complementary filter, not the PID loop. Testing on a custom
						stand (allowing pitch, roll, yaw, and limited vertical motion) let us evaluate
						stability safely indoors while supplying power and USB connections.

					<h3>Results of the Design</h3>
			
					<!-- Test data -->
					<h4>Test Data, Scope Traces&nbsp;&amp; Waveforms</h4>
					<p>
						We primarily evaluated the drone on a custom-designed gimbal stand that allowed safe
						experimentation of all rotational axes (roll, pitch, yaw) and limited vertical motion.
						This test rig let us study hover stability, responsiveness, and overall system behavior
						under controlled conditions.
					</p>
					<p>PID response was examined by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tapping the frame to introduce known disturbances and observing the response.</li>
						<li>Applying sudden throttle changes and analyzing recovery behavior.</li>
						<li>Streaming gyro data over serial for real-time monitoring.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These experiments led to the finalized PID gains listed in Table&nbsp;4. Plotting the
						1&nbsp;kHz data stream in real time was impractical because it degraded control-loop
						performance.
					</p>
			
					<!-- Speed -->
					<h4>Speed of Execution</h4>
					<p>
						The control loop runs at 1&nbsp;kHz, a rate chosen for its
						balance of stability and computational headroom on the Pico&nbsp;W. At this speed we
						observed <em>no</em> hesitation, flicker, or perceptible latency; the drone responded
						immediately to throttle changes and external disturbances.
					</p>
			
					<!-- Accuracy -->
					<h4>Accuracy</h4>
					<p>
						Orientation estimates remained accurate for short flight windows (2&nbsp;–&nbsp;3&nbsp;min),
						with minor long-term drift attributed to IMU noise and complementary-filter limits.
						Hover control was solid, although yaw corrections occasionally lagged due to
						cross-axis torque coupling.
					</p>
			
					<!-- Safety -->
					<h4>Safety Measures</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Gimbal test stand:</strong> Restricts movement while preserving realistic
							control dynamics.</li>
						<li><strong>Arm/disarm switch:</strong> Prevents unintended motor spin-up.</li>
						<li><strong>Failsafe shutdown:</strong> Motors cut immediately on lost communication.</li>
						<li><strong>Battery-only flights:</strong> USB used solely for bench testing and tuning.</li>
						<li><strong>Integral reset on arm:</strong> Clears accumulated <em>I</em> error and protects
							operators.</li>
						<li><strong>Optional prop guards:</strong> Printable guards integrate with the frame for
							added protection.</li>
					</ul>
			
					<!-- Usability -->
					<h4>Usability</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Builder script:</strong> One-command firmware compile and flash.</li>
						<li><strong>Serial PID tuner:</strong> Real-time gain adjustments accelerate iteration.</li>
						<li><strong>Open-source HW/SW:</strong> Fully reproducible for ECE/MAE coursework.</li>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			
					<!-- Design analysis -->
					<h4>Design Analysis&nbsp;&amp; Future Work</h4>
					<p>
						Given more time, after a thorough analysis outlined in the section “background method,”
						we would obtain the equations of motion and proceed to linearize them about the desired
						hover position. These would then guide us in our tuning process by suggesting ranges of
						values for which the controller gains would result in a stable hovering
						equilibrium. In particular, the MATLAB Controls Toolbox would likely be vital in this
						process. We would then iterate over a loop of trial and tuning until we obtain the
						desired response characteristics.
					</p>
			
					<!-- Standards -->
					<h4>Conformance to Standards</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>IEEE&nbsp;21451:</strong> Digital communication with the IMU and radio
							receiver follows the smart-transducer interface principles of this standard,
							supporting modular sensor expansion via the Pico&nbsp;W’s Wi-Fi.</li>
			
						<li><strong>IEEE&nbsp;829 (Test Documentation):</strong> Although informal, our testing
							methodology (PID tuning, safety checks, failure recovery) mirrored the repeatable
							planning and documentation practices prescribed by this standard.</li>
			
						<li><strong>FCC&nbsp;Part&nbsp;15:</strong> The 2.4&nbsp;GHz link between transmitter
							and ELRS receiver complies with ISM-band emissions limits; the system emits no
							intentional radiation outside the allowed spectrum.</li>
			
						<li><strong>ISO&nbsp;12100 (Risk Assessment):</strong> Startup gyro calibration,
							arm/disarm logic, and motor cutoff on communication loss embody this standard’s
							safety principles. Indoor testing on a gimbal stand further reduced risk.</li>
			
						<li><strong>ISO&nbsp;9001 (Quality Management):</strong> While uncertified, we followed
							its quality principles through version-controlled development, structured
							documentation, and modular integration, supporting maintainability and
							reproducibility for future coursework.</li>
