    <h1 class="title">Automatic Music Stand </h1>
    <p>Fall 2025 ECE4760 Final Project By Kotey Ashie (kaa86), Lina Hao(lh657)</p>
    <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
    <p>Our project is a hands-free, automatic music stand that turns pages in response to user motion. </p>
    <p>The user wears a motion-detecting band on their arm or leg, and when they move, the stand detects the signal and
      automatically turns the page. This system allows musicians to turn pages hands-free, minimizing performance
      interruptions.
    </p>
    <h2>High-Level Design</h2>
    <p>Our main rationale for choosing this project is because turning music pages while playing an instrument is
      inconvenient and disruptive. Musicians often need to pause mid-performance to flip pages or rely on someone else
      to
      do it for them. To address this, we envisioned a music stand that detects simple arm or leg movements and
      automatically turns the page, allowing for smoother performances.

    <h2>Hardware Design </h2>
    <h3>Electrical Components </h3>

    <h3>Microcontroller</h3>
    <p>All system control is performed by the RP2040 microcontroller. It manages real-time angle estimation, motor
      control through a PID algorithm, and user interaction via a UART serial interface and push button. The RP2040
      receives raw accelerometer and gyroscope data from the ICM-20948 IMU over I2C, and it processes this data through
      a complementary filter to estimate the helicopter arm’s angle.
    </p>
    <h3>Motor Driver Circuit</h3>
    <p>A custom motor driver circuit was assembled on a solderboard to ensure reliable high-current handling. The
      circuit uses a 4N35 optoisolator to provide electrical isolation between the RP2040 and the power electronics. The
      circuit includes a logic-level N-channel MOSFET, a 1N4001 diode placed in parallel with the motor, and a 0.1µF
      capacitor. The motor is powered by a dedicated 5 V supply. A 12 V DC supply is used to drive the gate of the
      N-channel MOSFET. SPST kill switch is placed in series with the motor power to allow emergency shutdowns during
      testing.

    <h3>IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)</h3>
    <p>The ICM-20948 IMU provides 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data. It is connected to the RP2040 via the I2C
      interface and powered from the 3.3V rail. The IMU is mounted close to the rotating arm to accurately measure its
      angular displacement. The onboard gyroscope is used to track angular velocity, while the accelerometer provides a
      reference for angle, especially at rest. A complementary filter fuses the two signals to generate a stable and
      responsive angle estimate.
    </p>
    <h3>Stepper Motor </h3>
    <p> The stepper motor is employed in the system where high torque and precise incremental rotation are required. It
      is driven by the stepper motor driver circuit. The RP2040 outputs step pulses at a controlled frequency to dictate
      motor speed and position. </p>
    <h3>Servo Motor </h3>
    <p>A standard hobby servo motor is used for tasks requiring precise angular positioning over a limited range. The
      servo is controlled using a PWM signal generated by one of the RP2040’s GPIO pins.
    </p>
    <h2>Page Turning Mechanism</h2>
    <h3>Original Design</h3>
    <img src="original_design.png">
    <p>The original design for page turning operates as follows: Cut hex keys would be positioned vertically, each held
      within slots in a rack. Paper clips would be attached to the tops of each of the hex keys in order to hold the
      pages for turning. This rack would be driven by a top-mounted motor. Upon receiving a signal from the IMU, the
      motor would rotate the pinion, shifting the rack horizontally and aligning the next hex key into a central
      position. Once aligned, a bottom motor would rotate the selected hex key using a gear attached directly to it,
      initiating the page-turning motion. This setup supports forward and backward turning of up to 11 pages of sheet
      music and is compatible with sheet music in books, binders, or as loose pages.
    </p>
    <h3>Backup Design</h3>
    <img src="backup_design.png">
    <p>Due to time constraints, we were unable to 3D print our original design and instead implemented a backup
      mechanism. This alternative setup uses a cardboard sheet as the base, with another sheet setup in a right angle
      perpendicular to the base. Perpendicular sheet includes a slot to hold a motor with an attached wheel, positioned
      next to a servo motor with a popsicle stick arm. When the system is placed on a stand with sheet music, either in
      a book, binder, resting on the cardboard base, the wheel Moves through the slot due to gravity to the top most
      page of sheep music. Upon receiving a signal from the IMU, the wheel spins just long enough to lift the page,
      after which the servo motor completes the flipping of the page using the attached popsicle stick. This setup
      supports forward turning only and but could be used for far more pages.
    </p>
    <h2>Program Design</h2>
    <p> Our program adapts code from the ECE 4760 PID control lab to control two motors using PWM on the RP2040
      microcontroller. Motion detection is implemented using an MPU6050 IMU, and when a quick movement is detected from
      the user, the motors are activated to simulate a page turn.The system uses an interrupt service routine
      on_pwm_wrap
      and a protothread protothread_motor to coordinate motor control and timing.</p>
    <p>Two global boolean flags are used for synchronization as well: motion_detected is set to true when motion is
      detected, and wait_ended ensures that motion detection is only allowed again after a two-second cooldown period.
    </p>
    <h3>Interrupt Service Routine</h3>
    <p>The on_pwm_wrap function is called on every PWM cycle wrap, and it serves as the main interrupt service routine
      (ISR) for motion detection.</p>
    <p>The ISR starts by clearing the interrupt flags for both motors using pwm_clear_irq, ensuring that the interrupt
      system is properly reset and ready for the next event. Then, it reads in raw accelerometer and gyroscope
      measurements from the MPU6050 IMU using mpu6050_read_raw, and these measurements are stored in the acceleration
      and
      gyro arrays respectively. The program then checks whether the detected y-axis acceleration is greater than 1.0g,
      indicating that the user has made a quick motion, and whether wait_ended is true, indicating that the wait period
      is
      over.</p>
    <p>If the conditions above are met, then the program sets a PWM duty cycle to both motors using pwm_set_chan_level,
      and the onboard LED is turned on as a visual indicator. The motion_detected and wait_ended flags are set to true
      and
      false respectively to signal the motor thread and begin the cooldown period. While the PWM output to the DC motor
      works as intended, we were not able to successfully spin the servo motor using our current configuration.
    </p>

    <h3>Motor Control Thread</h3>
    <p>The protothread_motor thread manages motor timing behavior. It waits until the motion_detected flag is true, and
      once triggered it waits for 0.2 seconds, allowing the motors to run briefly and simulate a page turn. After this,
      the duty cycle for both motors is set to 0 to prevent the motors from spinning, the LED is reset, and
      motion_detected is set back to false. The thread then waits for an additional two more seconds to enforce a
      cooldown
      period on motion detection. After the wait, the wait_ended flag is set to true and the thread resumes waiting for
      the next motion event.
    </p>
    <h3>Main Function</h3>
    <p>In the main function, essential peripherals are initialized, including LED initialization, MPU6050
      initialization,
      I2C configuration, and PWM configuration. The on_pwm_wrap ISR is also linked to the PWM interrupt and enabled.
      Then,
      the motor control thread is added to the scheduler on core 0.
    </p>
    <h2>Results of the Design </h2>
    <p> With our implementation, we were able to get the stand to roll up the next page when a motion was detected
      through the band. However, due to a last-minute switch into our backup design, we were unable to get the stand to
      fully turn the page automatically.
      Regarding safety, we ensured that the motors would be held in place during operation and utilized a motor driver
      circuit to safely manage high current.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Overall, our results did not fully meet our initial expectations, but we successfully implemented the mechanism
      for rolling up a page before it is turned. If we had more time, we would have looked into implementing the music
      stand with our original design rather than the backup design. </p>
