							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
							<p>
								As mentioned in the results section, the design is not very portable. In future iterations of the project, the Raspberry Pi and Neopixel LEDs would both be powered through battery packs stepped down to 3.3V using a buck converter. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi could be interfaced with a Bluetooth speaker to reduce the wiring required to run the system. Additionally, the stepper motor wires and Neopixel LED wires could be run through the inside of the hollow mechanical arm to prevent wires from being exposed to areas that the baby could potentially reach and injure themselves. Lastly, the breadboard circuit could be soldered onto a protoboard or made into a PCB to clean up the wiring. 
							</p>
							<p>
								For this project, a lot of the libraries came from different sources. The stepper motor drivers were pulled from the examples on the course website, and the neopixel LED drivers were pulled from Raspberry Pi Pico Examples on Github[2]. Additionally, the mechanical arm was a design from Thingiverse and was originally designed by nicolehvst and was modified to include a mount for the stepper motor[3].
