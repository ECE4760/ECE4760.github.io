      Our final project for ECE 4760 is a strategic two-person combat game inspired by the open source fighting game
      "Footsies", a simple game designed to test the players spacing, timing and combat skills.
      <br>
      <br>

      Our build leverages the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller connected to a VGA screen for visual display, with
      player input handled through keypads inputs. The game allows players to execute a variety of combat maneuvers,
      including attacks, blocks, shields, jumps, and crouches. The combat takes place in the critical "no man's land"
      between fighters, where positioning and tactical decisions determine victory or defeat. The Pico microcontroller
      processes player inputs with minimal latency, ensuring a responsive and fair competitive experience. Whether
      you're trading blows at mid-range or executing a perfect defensive maneuver, the system offers an engaging and
      intuitive gaming experience that captures the strategic depth of spacing-based combat games.

        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>
            No Man's Land is a minimalist two-player fighting game inspired by Footsies, developed for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. Our objective is to create an accessible, strategic combat experience that focuses on the fundamental spacing and timing elements of fighting games. Players control pixel-art fighters using keypads to execute a variety of moves including attacks, blocks, shields, jumps, and crouches within a frame-based combat system. The game employs the Pico's dual-core capabilities, with one core dedicated to player animation and another to the user interface, all displayed on a VGA screen with audio feedback through a speaker. By implementing a health bar system, match timer, and intuitive controls, No Man's Land delivers an engaging local multiplayer experience that demonstrates embedded systems programming while being approachable for players of all skill levels.</p>

    <h2>High-level Design</h2>
    <h4>Rationale</h4>
    <p>Our goal for this project was to create a fun fighting game run off the Pico microcontroller. To do this
      we drew inspiration from the open source fighting game "Footsies", a simple game designed to test the players
      spacing, timing and combat skills.
      Taking the core moves and sprites from the game, we built our own game with new mechanics, art and sound effects.
    </p>

    <h4>UI Structure</h4>
    <p>Below shows the various UI screens and the state machine controlling the transistion between the UI screens. When
      the game boots up it will display a title screen. From here, the players can press any key to enter the menu
      screen where the players
      can customize their character models and clothing. From here, both players can press the same key to enter the
      game. Within the game, the players
      can choose to pause the game and return to the title. When a player wins, the game will display a win screen based
      on which character won.

    <h4>Game Structure</h4>
    <p>Due to the amount of possible interactions between the player, we implement another state machine to
      handle the game logic. At a high level, each player is in one of three possible positions: idle, crouching or
      jumping.
      Each of these positions has a set of possible actions that can be performed and rules that dictate the
      interactions between the players.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/game_logic.jpg" alt="state_machine_diagram.png" class="section-img">
      <figcaption>Figure 3: Game logic state machine</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h5>Idle</h5>
    <p>The idle state is the base state that each player starts in. In this state, the player can walk left or right and
      has access to
      a kick attack and a uppercut attack. In this state, the player can also block other standing attacks with shield.
    </p>
    <h5>Jump</h5>
    <p>The jump state puts the player in the air. While in the air, if the player lands on the opponent, they will
      perform a 'drop attack'.
      A player is also able to block another 'drop attack' by jumping at the same time.
    </p>
    <h5>Crouch</h5>
    <p>The crouch state causes the player to duck. In this state, the player can perform a crouch attack and block other
      crouch attacks.
    </p>


    <h5>Shields / Hits</h5>
    <p>
      From each state, a player can be hit and will take damage. If a player is hit, no matter what state they are in
      they will enter a 'hurt' state.
      After the 'hurt' animation plays out, the player will return to the idle state. If a player takes damage, their
      health
      decreases depending on the attack. When a players health reaches 0, they lose the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important mechanic in the game is the shield. Each player starts the game with 3 shields and can
      use them to block different attacks. For the shield to be effective, the player must be performing the correct
      action
      before being hit (the blocks are shown above). If a player shields an attack, they will not take damage however
      they will
      lose a shield. If a player runs out of shields, they will take damage from any attack. To get shields back, the
      player must
      hit the opponent when the opponent shield. This adds a layer of strategy to the game as players must decide when
      to shield and when to attack.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/shield_bar.png" alt="Shield Options" class="section-img">

    </figure>
    <p>
      The above figure displays the health and shield bar. The shield bar can be distinguished by the 3 sections,
      each representing a shield.
    </p>

    <h4>Sprites and Art</h4>
    <p>
      The player sprites were drawn over the original footsies sprites using Procreate (iOS) and PixelStudio (Android).
      The visual style is intentionally minimalist, limited to black and white. This allowed us to keep the same
      outlines however different heads and clothing models from the Footsies game. To integrate these assets into our
      game, we wrote a Python
      script that converts each sprite into a two-dimensional C array.
      <br>
      <br>
      For memory efficiency, our drawSprite function in C only takes the coordinates of either only black pixels or only
      white pixels depending on which one is fewer, and renders those, effectively outlining the sprite without needing
      to store full image data. Most of our animations consist of multiple frames â€“ such as a five-frame attack sequence
      (Figure 4.). For each frame, we store an array of pixels (Figure 5.), with each pixel representing a displacement
      from the origin position of the player. This origin position is defined at the center of the player on the ground.
      Offsets are scaled by 4 to make sprites look bigger on screen.

    </figure>

    <p>
      In addition to the player sprite sheets, the game also includes a variety of art for the various display screens
      and background parts. Each of these components was stored in similar C arrays and drawn modularly rather than
      as a whole because many
      either need to move (eg. background clouds) or need to be switched around (eg. character select screen).

    </figure>
    <p>
      The input to the game utilizes 2 keypads. These matrix-like keypads work by setting the columns of the matrix high
      one at a time. By then checking which GPIO receives an input we can determine which key is pressed at any time.

      Because we needed many GPIO pins to write to the VGA screen and DAC we decided to let both keypads
      share the same scan GPIO keys. That way we save on GPIO pins and a single scan
      allows us to check both keypads.

    </p>
    <p>
      For the audio, we utilize both channels of the DAC to
      play sound effects and music. Initially, we struggled to play both sound effects and
      music at the same time without significant noise. By utilizing stereo speakers, we can plug one DAC channel into
      the right speaker and
      one into the left. This minimizes the amount of interference between the sound effects and music and also allows
      both
      to play at the same time.

    </p>
    <h4>Player States and Frames</h4>
    As with most fighting games, all of the timing is based on a frame timer system. Each frame corresponds to a step of
    the game. Within one frame, we must parse inputs, check for all interaction between the players then update the VGA
    screen. Utilizing frames also allows us to play the animations for the proper amount of time. For example the â€˜hurtâ€™
    state in the figure below is a sequence of 4 sprites. When a player enters the â€˜hurtâ€™ state, we can simply draw one
    sprite per frame to complete the animation.
    <figure>
      <img src="images/frame images.png" alt="keypads_wired.png" class="section-img"
        style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
      <figcaption>Figure 11: Frames of hurt</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Each player is represented by a struct consisting of many variables making up the player's current state. The
      state of a player consists of information about the players game status (eg. health, shield, hitbox) as well as
      what animation should be played on a given frame (eg. state, frame)
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/player state.png" alt="keypads_wired.png" class="section-img"
        style="width: 100%; max-width: 640px;">
      <figcaption>Figure 12: Player States.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The player state is updated every frame. Each frame, we check the inputs of both players and update the player
      state accordingly. For example, if a player presses the left key, we will update the player x to position to the left. Each 
      state has a unique animation associated for it. For example, when a player attacks we will set the player state to attack. This 
      state corresponds to the set of frames for the attack animation. Each frame is then drawn sequentially until the attack has reached 
      the last frame. For attacks, we also need to check if the attack hits the opponent. This is done with our hitbox system. Each attack 
      has a hitbox associated with it which we use to check collision. 
    </p>

    <h4>Playing sounds</h4>
    <p>
      There are 3 types of sounds in our game:
    <ol>
      <li>background music from note frequency arrays through time interrupts,</li>
      <li>sound effects from note frequency arrays through time interrupts (The beep in menu screens)</li>
      <li>sound effects from .wav files through DMA.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      To play arrays of note frequencies through time interrupts, similar to lab 1, we compute the current increment
      amount and update the accumulator according to current frequency:
    </p>
    phase_incr_main_0 = current_frequency * two32_fs and phase_accum_main_0 += phase_incr_main_0
    <p>
      The BGM and sound effects of notes share the same channel, so only one of them is being played. However, the
      counter for BGM does not pause while sound effects are being played, so that in theory it sounds as if the BGM is
      always playing and only happens to be unheard sometimes since the sound effect is too loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      A set of complex sound effects utilize DMA channels to be played. These sound effects include the whooshing sound
      of attacks, the shielding sound and the hurt sound. In addition, at the start of each match the game will yell
      â€˜Fightâ€™, which is also an effect played through DMA. We accomplished this by first converting the .wav files of
      the sounds found on free sound effect websites into C arrays. Each sound effect was then assigned 2 DMA channels,
      a control channel and data channel such as the hit sound effect below.

      <o1>
        <li>hit_chan = dma_claim_unused_channel(true);</li>
        <li> hitctrl_chan = dma_claim_unused_channel(true);
        </li>
      </o1>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the control channel is triggered, it is pointed to the data channel. The data channel then points to the
      location of the C array for the sound. The array is then transferred to SPI to the DAC playing the sound effect.
      The advantage of this is that the complex sound effects do not block the code and both complex sound effects and
      background music can be played simultaneously

    </p>

    <h4>Collision and Hitboxes</h4>
    <p>
      One of the more challenging parts of implementation was checking hits and collisions. We utilize a hitbox system,
      assigning each move and player a set hitbox. This is done in order to determine if attacks are valid or if the
      players are colliding with one another. While we could have checked the pixel overlaps of the sprites themselves,
      we found it much simpler to draw bounding boxes around the players and the moves. This allowed us to simplify the
      detection of collision and attack hits by checking overlapping rectangles.
    </p>
    <img src="images/hitboxes_array.jpg" alt="hitboxes_array.jpg">
    <figcaption>Figure 13: Hitboxes Array. {x_offset, y_offset, width, height} relative to player bottom center.
    </figcaption>
    <p>
      Each hitbox consists of {x_offset, y_offset, width, height}, where offsets are calculated from the bottom center
      of a playerâ€™s xy position. To check whether two hitboxes are overlapping, we wrote a function bool
      isOverlapping(short h1, short h2, short attacker), to which we pass the hitbox index of the attacker, hitbox index
      of the potential victim, and the player index of the attacker.

    </p>
    <p>
      Inside this function, based on each playerâ€™s current position and whether each player is flipped, we first
      calculate the absolute positions of the x boundaries and y boundaries of the hitboxes as:
    </p>
    <pre>
      short h1y1, h1y2, h2y1, h2y2, h1x1, h1x2, h2x1, h2x2;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Then, we check:
    </p>
    <pre>
            bool x_overlap = (h1x1 >= h2x1 && h1x1 <= h2x2)
                          || (h1x2 >= h2x1 && h1x2 <= h2x2)
                          || (h2x1 >= h1x1 && h2x1 <= h1x2)
                          || (h2x2 >= h1x1 && h2x2 <= h1x2);
            bool y_overlap = (h1y1 >= h2y1 && h1y1 <= h2y2)
                          || (h1y2 >= h2y1 && h1y2 <= h2y2) 
                          || (h2y1 >= h1y1 && h2y1 <= h1y2) 
                          || (h2y2 >= h1y1 && h2y2 <= h1y2);
    </pre>
    <p>
      The final result is (x_overlap && y_overlap). For debugging purposes, we enabled
      a function to draw the hitboxes on the screen as well. Below show a couple figures of the hitboxes for certain
      moves. The hitbox both
      allows us to check for attack hits as well as make sure that players cannot walk through each other.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      An initial concern of ours was meeting the timing deadline of 10FPS
      as we are performing many checks and VGA drawings however we did not have any problems throughout our development.
      While occasionally we would suffer from noise in the sound effects, we found that after splitting the sound
      effects and music into different speakers much of it was reduced. Another concern of ours was the collision checking. 
      We were worried that there would possibly be bugs in the collision checking causing players to get stuck, however this 
      was resolved with the bounding box system.

    <h4>Playtesting</h4>
    <p>
      Of course because this is a video game, the goal is to make it fun. While we played it for many rounds and had
      another group come play as well. The experience is smooth once you get used to the keypad controls.
      The main feedback we received was with the balancing of the game, where certain strategies such as crouch attack
      were too strong. With more playtesting, we could further balance the game by adding more moves and mechanics.

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      We are very happy with how the game turned out. We essentially created what we set out to do in the proposal which
      was just a fun fighting game that ran smoothly on the Pico. In the future however we would like to add more moves
      and features which we had initially thought of. For example we wanted to add â€˜comboâ€™ moves or extra movement
      options such as dashing. While we didn't add any color to the art, we definitely could have changed the art style 
      to include color as we still had plenty of memory. The game however is still very smooth to run and more importantly 
      fun to play. We are very happy with the final product and are proud of the work we did.
      </p>
      <p>
      While we did not use any code in the public domain, we did draw over art from the â€˜Footsiesâ€™ video game. Footsies
      is an open source game under the GPL-3.0 license allowing for derivative works.
