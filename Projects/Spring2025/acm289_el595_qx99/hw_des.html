<h1>Hardware Design<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-design" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Our system was composed of three types of board:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A controller board (located at the main playing level, acting as the
primary user interface)</p></li>
<li><p>A sensor board (located in the belfry for collecting sensor measurements)</p></li>
<li><p>Four face boards (located in each clock face for driving the LEDs)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these boards communicate over a shared CAN bus for reliable
communication of information. While both the control and sensor board
have access to an outlet (and can be powered through a 5V DC power
supply), all of the clock face boards will rely on pre-existing 12V
DC power converters already installed in the tower. For our project,
we chose to use a Pico W for each board, as opposed to just a Pico, to
allow for WiFi communication (as well as Bluetooth, should future
groups choose to expand the system using the same hardware).</p>
<div class="note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Different Supplies</p>
<p>The different power supplies and corresponding absolute voltages could
theoretically provide communication issues by referencing different
grounds; however, CAN communication relies on the difference between
two lines, so absolute differences in supply voltages will not impact
our network.</p>

<h2>LED Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#led-setup" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The clocktower currently uses strips of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.superbrightleds.com/led-strips-and-bars/led-strip-lights-by-voltage/12-volt-led-strip-lights/5m-rgbw-led-strip-light-4-in-1-chip-5050-color-changing-led-tape-light-12v-24v-ip20">RGBW LEDs</a>
to light the clock faces. These LEDs have 5 pins: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+12V</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">W</span></code>. We suspected this meant that the non-power lines should
PWM’d to ground to adjust the amount of that color; after probing these
lines, as well as getting hints from the “Common Anode” marking on the
box, we confirmed that this was the case, with the model below showing
the strips in beige (anticipating connecting them to some form of switch)</p>

<p>One other consideration we had to make was the PWM frequency; too slow,
and the blinking would be observable to viewers. However, after probing
the current LED PWM output, we found the period to be about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.5ms\)</span>
(corresponding to a frequency of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim 133Hz\)</span>), which is easily
attainable by our PWM channels (set to around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4kHz\)</span>) and our
MOSFETs (which have rise and fall times in the tens of nanoseconds).</p>

<section id="can-transceiver">
<h2>CAN Transceiver<a class="headerlink" href="#can-transceiver" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>One particularly hardware-intensive component of our system were the
CAN transceivers; these were present on all boards to communicate over the
shared CAN bus. We chose to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/SN65HVD230DR/404366">SN65HVD230DR</a>
transceiver, as it had already been used in a CAN bus demo from Professor
Adams, allowing us to re-use the PIO program and accompaning C code
(albeit modifying as an object-oriented class for reusability across
programs for all the boards).</p>
<p>Aside from the transceiver itself, some other components are needed,
including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Terminating Resistors</strong>: Resistors are needed to pull the bus lines
together by default. While terminating resistors are strictly only
needed at the two ends of a bus, we wanted our system to be able to
handle any configuration of connected boards, and accordingly
terminated at all nodes of the bus. Additionally, CAN buses usually
have <em>standard termination</em> (a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(120\Omega\)</span> resistor between the
two lines); however, we opted for <em>split termination</em>, which uses two
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60\Omega\)</span> resistors instead to insert a capacitor between the
two lines, to low-pass noise. Our transceiver additionally supported
this by providing a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{V_{CC}}{2}\)</span> output to connect to the
midpoint and further stabilize the bus</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TVS Diode</strong>: A Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) diode was placed
between both bus lines and ground, preventing large voltage spikes from
damaging other electronics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slope Control</strong>: Our particular transceiver provided a pin which allowed
the device to be in low-power mode (pulled to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{CC}\)</span>), in
“high-speed” mode (pulled to ground), or in “slope-control” mode
(a resistor between the pin and ground), where the slope of
transmissions could be controlled by the resistor’s value. Since
we valued data integrity more than speed, we chose to have the
transceiver in “slope-control” mode by providing a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10k\Omega\)</span>
resistor, with an additional PMOS above to allow the microcontroller
to turn off transmissions by pulling the node high, such as during
setup to avoid noise</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This diode (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D1</span></code>), as well as the split termination resistors and
capacitor (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R7/R8/C7</span></code>) and smoothing capacitors (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C2/C3</span></code>) can be
seen in the example layout below from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn65hvd230.pdf">CAN transceiver datasheet</a>,

<section id="controller-board">
<h2>Controller Board<a class="headerlink" href="#controller-board" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The control board is the primary interface to the overall system. It
should allow users to easily change the colors, as well as the “mode” of
the LEDs, including being unconditionally on, pulsing with audio, or
turning on and off with ambient light. Accordingly, the board features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3 potentiometer sliders to control the amount of each color. LEDs of the
corresponding color are situated above each slider to give a visual
indication of how much of each color is present; this is done by using
PWM to control the perceived brightness of each LED, with each LED
connected to a separate PWM channel</p></li>
<li><p>A CAN transceiver connected to 5 pairs of outputs (in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1x10</span></code>
screw terminal block) for communicating with all other boards.</p></li>
<li><p>Switches to turn the board on and connect to WiFi, as well as a rotary
switch for controlling the LED mode. Additional LEDs show whether the
board is on and connected to WiFi</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="sensor-board">
<h2>Sensor Board<a class="headerlink" href="#sensor-board" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The sensor board lives in the top of the tower, and is responsible for
providing data about the amount of light and sound it detects. It includes
an ambient light sensor and a microphone, as well as a CAN transceiver to
communicate the data to the controller board.</p>

<section id="face-board">
<h2>Face Board<a class="headerlink" href="#face-board" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Finally, a face board lives in each of the clock faces. These boards are
responsible for receiving the target color from the controller board, and
adjusting the PWM duty rate for each of the LEDs appropriately.
Accordingly, they contain 4 high-power MOSFETs (one for each channel to
PWM), a CAN transceiver, and 2 LEDs to indicate both power and
communication with the controller board. To connect to the LEDs, we
noticed two controllers currently being used per face due to the
single strip output from them; to alleviate this, each face board has
two terminal blocks that each provide the 5 connections necessary for
the LED strip.</p>
<p>Unlike normal LEDs, the LED strips are particularly high-power; while
we couldn’t find the exact part number for the strips, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.superbrightleds.com/5m-rgb-w-led-strip-light-color-changing-led-tape-light-12v-24v-ip20?queryID=8bbe2fe09e8e713c40f2e17a41900dae#specifications">manufacturer’s website</a>
indicates that they could draw over an amp per meter, with a similar
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2439">product by Adafruit</a> indicating
up to 1.6 amps per meter. While we couldn’t get an exact length measurement of
the already-installed LEDs, the controller indicated a maximum load of
6 amps per channel, with the 12V voltage converters indicating a
maximum of 24 amps (sufficient for the 4 channels). Accordingly, we
chose our high-power driving MOSFETs and corresponding trace widths to
be sufficient for 6 amps; our <a class="reference external" href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/infineon-technologies/IRLB8721PBF/2127670">MOSFETs</a>
could handle up to 62 amps, and the traces were calculated for slightly
over 6 amps via KiCad’s trace calculator (perhaps being able to handle
a bit more), giving us confidence that they would work well with the
current setup.</p>

<section id="hardware-difficulties">
<h2>Hardware Difficulties<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-difficulties" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>During the implementation of these boards, we ran into several unusual
difficulties.</p>
<section id="face-board-shorting">
<h3>Face Board Shorting<a class="headerlink" href="#face-board-shorting" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When initially testing our boards, we noticed that one of the face boards
caused our power supply to produce a “whine”. After investigating, we
found an unusually low resistance between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VSYS</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GND</span></code> of the
Pico on board; other boards had this around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4k\Omega\)</span>, but the
offending board had around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(12.8\Omega\)</span> between these two pins,
likely acting as a short and causing excessive current draw. Given that
it only occurred on one board, it seemed unlikely (although possible) to
be an issue with the board, but rather the soldering; however,
thoroughly desoldering and even drilling out the connection between these
pins proved unable to remove the low-impedance connection. While the
other boards were sufficient for a system demonstration, remedying this
board will be necessary for all four faces to be operational beyond this
class.</p>
</section>
<section id="can-jump-starting">
<h3>CAN Jump-Starting<a class="headerlink" href="#can-jump-starting" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When initially connecting the CAN transceivers between the boards, we
expect both:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A board’s messages to be seen by other boards (when connected)</p></li>
<li><p>A board’s messages to be seen by itself (all the time)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, our boards were strangely unable to initially receive either
type of message when powered on. However, a strange remedy was found
to this issue; if the two CAN lines were shorted together briefly, both
types of messages would be received by the boards. Our current hypothesis
is that there is some initial deadlock in the CAN bus’ PIO implementation
that a temporary short is able to alleviate. While we can still demonstrate
communication, our system should ideally be able to start up on its own,
especially if a restart is required (by a watchdog timer or power
fluctuations, for example).</p>
