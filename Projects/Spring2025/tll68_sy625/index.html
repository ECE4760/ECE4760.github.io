    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="project">
      This project implements a real-time ball balancing system using a
      single-camera vision setup and a two-axis tilting platform, controlled
      with a Raspberry Pi 4 and RP2040 microcontroller. Our project aimed to
      develop a ball balancing system that uses a top-mounted camera to track
      the 2D position of a ball on a tilting platform. The Raspberry Pi 4
      handles image processing and position tracking, while we communicate the
      position to the RP2040 which controls the platform's tilt using two
      servos driven by PWM signals. The ball's position is continuously
      adjusted using a closed-loop PID controller to stabilize it at the
      center or balanced at a target position we can set. This project
      demonstrates real-time feedback control and image processing techniques,
      combining mechanical designs, software algorithms, and low-level
      hardware control.

    <h2>High-Level Design</h2>
    <p class="project" id="overview">
      We wanted to build something physical and expand on our previous work in
      the class implementing a PID controller for a one-degree-of-freedom
      helicopter. Throughout development, we introduced several simplifying
      assumptions to keep our implementation tractable while still capturing
      the system’s behavior. By constraining the platform tilt to ±10°, we
      applied the small-angle approximation (sin θ ≈ θ) to linearize
      gravitational torque into a simple proportional term. Instead of
      deriving a full forward-kinematic model for the servo linkages, we swept
      each servo through its range, measured the resulting platform angles
      with a digital level, and observed an approximately linear mapping
      between PWM input and tilt. To further enhance stability, we mounted the
      servo horns at the platform’s outer edge so that small servo-angle
      adjustments produce correspondingly smaller angular responses, reducing
      high-frequency jitter. Finally, we ignored secondary dynamics such as
      joint friction (mitigated by our ball bearings), since these effects
      were negligible compared to the dominant gravitational and inertial
      forces.<br /><br />
      We mounted a USB camera directly above the platform to provide a
      continuous top-down view of the ball. The camera plugs into the
      Raspberry Pi’s USB port, where we leverage OpenCV libraries to capture
      each frame and apply color threshold-based processing to isolate the
      ball’s center. Once we compute the ball’s x and y pixel coordinates, we
      package them into a simple data string and stream it over UART to the
      RP2040 for real-time control. Our vision loop runs at 30 Hz, which
      provides more than enough bandwidth for this task given the ball’s
      relatively high inertia and slow dynamics.<br /><br />
      On the RP2040, multiple threads handle distinct tasks: a parser thread
      processes incoming position data, a control thread runs the PID
      algorithm and updates each servo’s PWM output, and a VGA thread redraws
      live feedback, plotting error terms and the ball’s real-time position on
      screen so we can visualize how those errors affect our control of the
      system.

    <h3>Ball Tracking</h3>

    <p class="project">
      Our ball-tracking script on the Raspberry Pi is organized into three
      parts: camera capture, ball detection, and UART transmission. In the
      camera capture stage, we initialize the USB camera on the Pi's USB port
      and enter a continuous loop to grab each raw frame. To speed up the
      image processing, we immediately resize every frame to 320x240 pixels.
      It wasn't necesay to use the full resolution to track the ball's
      position and this also reduces compute time for masks and contour
      calculations. During ball detection each frame is passed to the
      detect_ball function. Inside the detect_ball function, we apply a
      gaussian blur to reduce sensor noise and then convert the result to HSV
      color space. We threshold on a calibrated orange range to produce a
      binary mask and clean it with morphological open and close operations so
      the ball appears as a solid blob as shown below.
    </p>
    <img class="diagram" src="website/images/ECE5730_ball_binary.png" alt="Binary Ball Tracking"
      style="width: 40%; height: auto" />
    <p class="caption">Binary Ball Tracking</p>

    <p class="project">
      After converting to a binary image, we call cv2.findContours() to
      extract all contours, select the largest one, and fit a minimum
      enclosing circle around it. If the detected radius exceeds our 10-pixel
      threshold, we assume it's the ball and return its (x, y, radius) tuple;
      otherwise, detect_ball returns None. Below, you can see the result
      overlaid with the detected circle and an arrow pointing to the
      platform's center. Initially, we wrote a script to compute the exact
      center dynamically, but found that tilting the platform didn't shift it
      enough to matter. Since the camera is mounted directly above the
      platform's center, we hard-coded the center as a black cross to
      eliminate random shifts and save extra computation on the Raspberry Pi.
    </p>

      style="width: 40%; height: auto" />
    <p class="caption">Ball Tracking</p>

    <p class="project">
      In the UART transmission stage, the main loop checks whether detect_ball
      found a valid circle. When it does, we format the ball's pixel
      coordinates as a string (x,y) and send it over serial to the RP2040.
      This enables our microcontroller to respond to the ball's position in
      real time. We run the entire pipeline at 30 Hz, which is sufficient
      given the ball's relatively high inertia and the dynamic response of our
      balancing platform.
    </p>

    <h3>UART communication</h3>
    <p class="project">
      The UART communication between the Raspberry Pi 4 and the RP2040 is a
      critical component of our project, enabling real-time data exchange for
      precise platform control. The RP2040, responsible for controlling the
      servos, receives continuous updates about the ball’s position from the
      Raspberry Pi. This data link is established using a UART connection,
      configured at a baud rate of 115200 bps, which we found to be a good
      balance between speed and data integrity. The physical wiring connects
      the RP2040’s UART1 interface, using GPIO 8 for transmission (TX) and
      GPIO 9 for reception (RX), with the corresponding UART pins on the
      Raspberry Pi. Proper grounding between the two devices was also
      essential to prevent signal noise and data corruption.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      On the RP2040, the UART communication is managed through a protothread
      that constantly monitors incoming data. This thread reads each character
      from the UART buffer, looking for complete coordinate messages formatted
      as (x,y). Once a message is detected, it is parsed and smoothed using an
      exponential moving average to reduce jitter. The smoothing process uses
      a formula like smoothed_x = 0.4 * smoothed_x + 0.6 * num1, which
      balances stability and responsiveness. The resulting smoothed
      coordinates are then used to compute the position error relative to the
      platform’s center, clamped within a range of -80 to 80 to prevent
      overextension of the servos.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      On the Raspberry Pi, the corresponding Python code uses a simple
      function to send the (x,y) data over UART. This function formats the
      message as a string before transmission, ensuring compatibility with the
      RP2040’s parser. Early versions of this code faced challenges with
      buffer overflows and signal noise, but these were resolved through
      careful tuning of the buffer size and smoothing parameters. Overall,
      this communication setup provides a stable and responsive link between
      the image processing and platform control components of our system.

    <h3>Balancer Platform</h3>
    <p class="project">
      We built the entire tilting platform from 3D-printed parts, assembled
      with screws and ball bearings, all anchored to a wooden base plate. The
      entire platform and the servo mounts were designed using Onshape CAD
      software. We assembled all the pieces and tested the structure’s motion
      in software first to minimize the number of reprints. For the pivot
      mechanism, we took inspiration from an existing design but upgraded it
      with ball bearings to achieve smooth rotation across all degrees of
      freedom. The 3D-printed tilt assembly is screwed directly to the wood,
      and a simple wooden structure holds the camera directly over the
      platform’s center for top-down view. We 3D-printed servo holders so we
      could screw the servos in place and then printed lever arms to connect
      the balancing platform to the servo. The lever arm attaches to the servo
      via a male connector with a screw hole, as shown below. 3D printing
      allowed us to rapidly prototype and create a simple structure that
      tilted with low friction. Finally, we chose a bright green mat and a
      contrasting orange ball to simplify color-based segmentation, making our
      vision pipeline both fast and reliable.

    <h3>Balancer PID Servo control</h3>
    <p class="project">
      The PID control system is the core of our platform’s stabilization
      mechanism, converting the ball’s position error into precise servo
      commands that adjust the platform’s tilt. This approach allows the
      system to rapidly and accurately respond to changes in the ball’s
      position, keeping it centered even as it moves dynamically. The RP2040
      microcontroller manages this process, using a pair of PWM channels to
      drive the two servos that control the platform’s pitch and roll.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      The servos are driven using pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals, which
      the RP2040 generates with a fixed frequency of 50Hz, the standard for
      most hobbyist servos. This frequency was chosen because it matches the
      servo’s expected control rate, providing consistent and smooth motion.
      The PWM duty cycle, which directly controls the servo angle, is
      calculated using the angle_to_level function. This function maps the
      desired angle, expressed in degrees, to a corresponding pulse width in
      microseconds. The range is typically 500 µs for 0° to 2500 µs for 180°,
      but we constrained this to 85° to 165° to avoid physical overextension
      and reduce the risk of mechanical wear. This narrower range reflects the
      actual tilt limits of our 3D-printed platform, ensuring stable operation
      even during aggressive ball movements.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      The main control logic is implemented within the on_pwm_wrap interrupt
      service routine (ISR), which is called at the end of each PWM cycle.
      This ISR is critical for maintaining real-time control, as it ensures
      that the servo positions are updated as quickly as possible in response
      to changing ball positions. The ISR first clears the interrupt flag,
      then reads the current position error values (x_error and y_error) from
      the global variables that are continuously updated based on UART input
      from the Raspberry Pi. These errors are then converted from
      floating-point to fixed-point format for efficient computation,
      reflecting our decision to use fixed-point arithmetic throughout the PID
      loop to reduce computational overhead and improve real-time performance.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      Within the ISR, the PID control is implemented as a sum of three terms:
      proportional, integral, and derivative. The proportional term (P)
      directly scales the current position error, providing immediate
      correction. The integral term (I) accumulates the sum of past errors,
      helping to eliminate steady-state offset by gradually reducing long-term
      drift. However, to prevent the integral term from growing too large and
      causing unstable behavior, the integral sum is clamped to a maximum
      value. This approach, known as anti-windup, prevents the integral term
      from overwhelming the other components of the PID controller during
      prolonged error conditions.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      The derivative term (D) is particularly important for this application,
      as it adds a damping effect that helps stabilize rapid movements. It is
      calculated as the difference between the current error and the previous
      error, scaled by a derivative gain. To prevent noise from causing
      excessive correction, the derivative term is also clamped to a
      reasonable range. Once all three terms are computed, the final control
      output is smoothed using a low-pass filter to reduce jitter. This
      smoothing is achieved by blending the current control signal with the
      previous output, using a fixed weighting factor to strike a balance
      between responsiveness and stability.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      Tuning the PID coefficients required extensive experimentation. Initial
      attempts with low derivative gains led to significant overshoot and
      oscillation, while excessive integral terms caused slow recovery from
      large disturbances. After several rounds of testing, we settled on a set
      of coefficients (P = 0.32, I = 0.2, D = 4.8) that provided responsive
      and stable performance across a wide range of operating conditions. This
      tuning, combined with the efficient fixed-point processing, enabled our
      system to maintain accurate control even under rapid, unpredictable ball
      movements.

    <h3>VGA Display</h3>
    <p class="project">
      The VGA display in our project provides real-time visual feedback for
      both the ball’s position and the PID control signals, making it an
      essential tool for debugging and fine-tuning the system. The display is
      divided into two main sections: a graphical representation of the
      physical platform and a set of live data plots.

    <p class="project">
      Additionally, the VGA thread plots the PID control signals in two
      separate graphs. The top graph shows the current servo angles, while the
      bottom graph displays the control error values. These plots use
      different colors to differentiate the proportional, integral, and
      derivative components, providing a clear view of the control dynamics.
      The thread includes a simple frame rate control mechanism to ensure the
      display updates smoothly, maintaining consistent performance even during
      rapid movements.

    <p class="caption">PWM meets the deadline</p>

    <p class="project">
      For our final design, the ball balancer effectively demonstrated its
      core functions, including automatic centering and targeted corner
      positioning. The above image shows the PWM signals outputted by the
      RP2040.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      In terms of basic balancing, the platform is generally able to stabilize
      the ball when it is gently pushed from any direction. This is because
      the PID controller responds quickly to small disturbances, correcting
      the ball’s position within a fraction of a second. However, the system
      struggles with more extreme inputs, such as when the ball is thrown onto
      the platform. In these cases, the ball’s initial speed and momentum
      often exceed the servos’ maximum response rate, leading to overshoot or
      instability. Although we did not conduct precise numerical measurements,
      our observations suggest that the system can consistently stabilize the
      ball when its speed is within the natural limits of the servos and
      platform. We plotted these servo operating limits as solid white lines
      (shown below on the VGA), and any control output beyond these bounds is
      clipped to prevent damage to the platform or servo motors.
    </p>

    <img class="diagram" src="website/images/PID_waveform.png" alt="PID tuning" style="width: 500px" />
    <p class="caption">PID Tuning</p>

    <p class="project">
      For the four-corner test, the system generally performed well, moving
      the ball to each corner in sequence with reasonable accuracy. However,
      we noticed a consistent issue with the bottom-right corner, where the
      ball sometimes failed to reach the exact target. We believe this is due
      to the foam platform’s physical characteristics. Because it was cut from
      a putting-green surface, its texture and “stimp” speed vary with
      direction, so friction differs depending on the ball’s path. These
      subtle surface irregularities introduce unpredictable resistance and
      prevent the integral term of our PID controller from fully compensating
      before the next corner command. Relying on a high integral gain in this
      situation caused the ball to accumulate error, and the only way to reset
      the integral term was by overshooting in the opposite direction, which
      occasionally sent the ball off the platform. To tune the four-corner
      routine successfully, we reduced the system’s responsiveness, trading
      peak speed for smoother, more controlled corner transitions.
    </p>

    <p class="project">
      During testing, we observed that once the ball reached its target it
      often wobbled because the servos continuously made small corrective
      motions. We traced this to our rounding in our position measurements. In
      our camera-tracking code we round the ball’s location to the nearest
      pixel. With a 320 × 240 frame, each pixel corresponds to a relatively
      large area in real space, so small sensor noise can cause the detected
      position to jump between adjacent pixels even when the ball is
      stationary. These pixel-level fluctuations then drive the derivative
      term of our PID controller, resulting in unnecessary control signals
      that keep the ball from coming fully to rest.
    </p>

    <p class="project">
      Safety considerations were also a critical part of our design. To
      prevent the servos from overextending and potentially damaging the
      platform, we carefully calibrated the servo angles before attaching the
      hinge, ensuring the platform operates within safe mechanical limits.
      Additionally, we tested for conditions that could cause the ball to fly
      off the platform, such as excessive initial velocity. We found that as
      long as the ball is placed or gently pushed onto the platform, the
      system maintains control, reducing the risk of the ball becoming a
      safety hazard.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      Overall, our ball balancer proved to be a practical and reliable system
      for real-time stabilization, with a few minor limitations that can
      likely be addressed with further tuning and mechanical improvements.
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="project">
      Our ball balancer project largely met our initial design goals,
      demonstrating reliable real-time control and effective position
      stabilization. The system successfully balanced the ball in the center
      of the platform and reached predefined corner positions, aligning well
      with our original expectations. However, we did encounter some
      performance limitations, particularly in handling high-velocity ball
      movements and precise corner positioning. These challenges were partly
      due to the physical characteristics of our foam platform, which
      introduced unpredictable resistance at certain points. If we were to
      repeat this project, we might consider using a platform with a more
      uniform, low-friction surface to improve overall consistency.
      Additionally, upgrading to faster, higher-torque servos could enhance
      the system's ability to respond to rapid position changes.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      In terms of standards, our design adhered to common best practices for
      embedded systems, including proper UART communication protocols,
      fixed-point arithmetic for efficient PID control, and well-defined
      electrical connections to avoid noise and interference. The servo
      control signals were also generated with precise timing to match the
      50Hz standard required by hobbyist servos, ensuring smooth and accurate
      movements.
    </p>
    <p class="project">
      Regarding intellectual property, we primarily relied on our own code for
      the PID control, UART communication, and VGA visualization. We did not
      use any proprietary Altera IP, nor did we incorporate publicly available
      code without modification. Our design was inspired by widely available
      ball balancing projects, but we developed our own software from scratch,
      avoiding potential patent or trademark conflicts. Given the unique
      combination of image processing, real-time control, and mechanical
      design, there may be patent opportunities if we refine the system
      further, particularly if we can overcome the current platform stability
      challenges.
