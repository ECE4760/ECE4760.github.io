            <p>
                In this project, we designed and built the Line Illustration for Natural, Uninterrupted Sketching
                machine (LINUS),a 2D-drawing machine that replicates input images in a one-line-drawing art style using
                a marker on paper. The system integrates image processing, optimal path planning, and precise motor
                control to produce clean and efficient renditions of complex images. Our work centered around three key
                components: a slicer to process and optimize the image, a Raspberry Pi and Pi Pico pair for
                communication and control, and a custom-built XY plotter driven by stepper motors.
                <br><br>
                The Raspberry Pi serves as the main controller, taking a user-supplied image and running it through our
                custom slicer algorithm. The slicer reduces the image to essential features and then computes an
                optimized continuous path that minimizes extraneous marker movement while maintaining visual fidelity.
                This path is then streamed via UART to the Pi Pico, which manages stepper motor control. The Pico drives
                the drawing head along the computed trajectory, sending “READY” signals back to the Pi after each
                segment is completed, ensuring synchronized and controlled motion.
                <br><br>
                Building LINUS required a combination of software and hardware design, from implementing optimal routing
                algorithms and controlling stepper motors to assembling a custom mechanical frame. This project
                reinforced key concepts in embedded systems, computer vision, graph algorithms, and real-time
                communication. It also demonstrated how physical constraints shaped our algorithm design, giving us
                hands-on experience with the challenges of translating digital instructions into real mechanical motion.
            </p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Our project idea came from seeing Hunter Adams’ example of using DDS to control an etch-and-sketch
                combined with his demonstration of using the Fourier Series to recreate Picasso’s one-line-drawings. We
                thought it would be interesting to automate the entire process of creating one-line-drawings physically,
                from an input image to the output image drawn by a marker.
            </p>

            <h3>General Process</h3>
            <p>
                Our project had three major parts:

            <br><br>
            A Raspberry Pi acts as the main controller. We give an image as input, and our slicer then processes the
            image to extract a minimal amount of important features and borders. The slicer then finds the best way
            to route the marker in one line over the processed image. It aims to minimize the amount the marker
            draws in an image, and especially the amount of space the marker draws on the paper that is not in the
            processed image.
            <br><br>
            The Raspberry Pi takes the path outputted by the slicer and turns it into a UART stream, sent to the Pi
            Pico coordinate by coordinate. The Pico drives the stepper motors (one for each axis) at constant
            velocity towards the current target coordinate. When it reaches the coordinate, it sends the Raspberry
            Pi a “READY” signal, indicating that it is ready for the next coordinate in the sliced path.
            The stepper motors drive a marker holder, which draws with the marker on a piece of paper attached to
            the print bed.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                The LINUS drawing machine performed very reliably. Once a drawing command was issued, the CoreXY
                mechanism executed paths with minimal hesitation, and the stepper motors moved smoothly without
                noticeable flicker or stutter. During testing, the system could complete a typical sketch in 1-2
                minutes, depending on the complexity of the input and density of control points. Movement speed was
                capped to avoid mechanical failures, but path execution remained responsive and fluid throughout.
                <br><br>
                We verified the performance of our stepper motor signals using an oscilloscope. As shown in the left
                figure below,
                the step pulses had a consistent spacing of 600 us, corresponding to a step frequency of 1.667 kHz - a
                rate we used during normal drawing operation to balance speed and mechanical stability. Additionally,
                the pulse width, as shown in figure below to the right, was measured to be 5 us, which is well within
                the required range
                for reliable triggering on standard stepper drivers. This also matches the intended behavior in the
                Pico’s firmware. These measurements confirm that our firmware generates clean, consistent pulses that
                are both frequent enough for smooth motion and long enough to be correctly interpreted by the driver
                hardware. Together, they validate the system’s ability to produce stable and accurate motion critical to
                LINUS’s operation.

            <p>
                The system achieved a drawing accuracy of approximately +/- 3mm, which was more than sufficient for
                producing clear and recognizable sketches. Minor inaccuracies were primarily caused by belt tension
                variations and the occasional slipping of the marker, which sometimes introduced slight wobbles in the
                drawn lines. However, these issues were largely resolved by properly tightening the related bolts. When
                the system was set up correctly, it operated without noticeable accuracy problems.
                <br><br>
                We can quantify this accuracy by examining the final drawings, specifically in regions where the plotter
                retraced lines. In these cases, the lines became slightly thicker but showed no visible gaps, indicating
                that the repeatability was within the width of the marker tip (3 mm). This small overlap not only
                validated the system’s precision but also produced an unintended aesthetic benefit, creating a shading
                effect that enhanced the visual appeal of the output.
                <br><br>
                In terms of image processing accuracy, edge detection consistently identified major contours in test
                images. While finer details were sometimes lost in thresholding or during resolution downsampling, the
                general structure of each image was very well preserved. The entire purpose of LINUS was to take images
                and convert them iconized drawings, so we finely tuned our image processing algorithms to discard a
                certain level of detail that would make the output consistent with an icon.
                <br><br>
                The conversion from pixel space to drawing coordinates introduced only minor distortion, with the final
                outputs definitely reflecting the input images’ shape and proportions. Since we settled on a system that
                could only drive the motors at -speed, 0, and +speed, the pen can only move in cardinal and ordinal
                directions. This is not an issue, however, because our generated waypoints are very close together, so
                we are still able to draw curves smoothly. If our waypoints were not so close, an issue would arise
                where curves would become corrugated, but this can be solved by interpolating between points and
                increasing waypoint density.
                <br><br>
                To enforce safety, we implemented several design decisions. Power came from a current-limited power
                supply, and all wires were routed securely so as to avoid entanglement with moving parts. Motor speed
                was capped to avoid disastrous and potentially dangerous mechanical failures, and soft stops were
                implemented in software to prevent the motors from exceeding the physical bounds of the drawing area,
                reducing the risk of mechanical damage.
                <br><br>
                LINUS was designed for ease of use by both team members and untrained users. Users can load an image and
                start the drawing with a simple command, watching as the system renders the sketch automatically on
                paper. Overall, we were very happy with the results, and genuinely enjoyed seeing our input images come
                to life in the one-line drawing style!
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                This project successfully demonstrated the design and implementation of LINUS - an
                Etch-A-Sketch-inspired automatic drawing machine. Our system used a CoreXY style belt drive mechanism to
                control the movement of a marker, allowing us to translate digital images into continuous, drawable
                paths using edge detection and graph algorithms. The mechanical structure achieved
                consistent movement with excellent stability and accuracy. On the software side, the system achieved
                accurate feature simplification and optimal path planning with one-line-drawing constraints. While the
                final
                drawing fidelity was slightly limited by the resolution
                and mechanical accuracy of the system, the curves traced on paper generally reflected the structure of
                the original image.
                <br><br>
                In the future we could improve the smoothness of the mechanical design by using V-slot rails instead of
                T-slot rails. In the slicer, we could also transform our slicing problem into existing solved problems
                like the Chinese Postman Problem, making our process even more efficient. Electrically, transitioning
                from a protoboard to a custom PCB would streamline the overall system design by integrating all the
                components into a compact and permanent layout. This would improve durability, reduce wiring complexity,
                and be easier to replicate.
                <br><br>
                Not only did we successfully meet our goals and expectations laid out in our project proposal, but we
                followed engineering best practices throughout the design and build process. This involved modularizing
                our code for readability, reusability, and ease of configuration, implementing thorough hardware testing
                before system integration, managing power distribution safely, and maintaining clear documentation for
                both hardware and software components.
                <br><br>
                We took inspiration for the mechanical design from existing 3D printers and <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgsTyhX311E">this youtube video</a>,
                but we made our own custom components and there were no patent issues. We used the following libraries:
                NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow, PyGame, Scikit-Image, Scikit-Learn, SciPy.
                <br><br>
                This project gave us the opportunity to merge artistic and engineering disciplines in a uniquely
                rewarding way. We applied concepts from microcontrollers, control systems, image processing, and
                mechanical design to build a system that could physically render an artistic interpretation of digital
                images. LINUS not only fulfilled our original vision but also reinforced many of the core topics we
                explored throughout the semester, providing a hands-on synthesis of theory and creativity.
