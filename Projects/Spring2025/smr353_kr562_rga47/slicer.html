            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p>
                The slicer’s objective is to take a target image and transform it into a set of waypoints that can be
                targeted by the physical printer, while optimizing for the best way to route the marker in one line over
                the processed image. The slicer aims to minimize the amount the marker draws in total, and especially
                the amount of space the marker draws on the paper that is not in the processed image.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>

            <h3>Image Processing</h3>
            <p>
                <i>For the following operations, our program makes use of the OpenCV, Numpy, Scikit, and Scipy
                    libraries.</i>
                <br><br>

                <br><br>

                To ensure that the printer is able to effectively do a “one-line-drawing”, the goal of the image
                processor is to minimize the amount of edges the printer needs to draw while still having a recognizable
                output image.

                <br><br>
                <strong>1. Fit all images to a square shape of 480 by 480 pixels</strong><br>
                We chose 480x480 experimentally, as it seemed to not lose too much resolution, but was still small
                enough that we later on did not have to discretize and lose resolution in our output sliced coordinates
                before inputting into our physical printer. We fit to a square to ensure that our printer (which is
                approximately square shaped) can effectively print the entire image). Additionally, we transform the
                image to grayscale to reduce the amount of feature noise.
                <br><br>

                <strong>2. Detect Edges</strong><br>
                We first use a Gaussian filter to blur the image. Adding blur reduces the amount of feature noise
                further. We then use the Canny Edge Detector to detect edges. Internally, the Canny Edge Detector
                smooths the image, finds the image gradient in the x and y directions using the Sobel operator, and then
                applies different thresholds and suppressions to find the most edges in the image that are most likely
                to be important.
                <br><br>

                <div style="font-style: italic; color: gray; margin-top: 5px;">2 Dimensional Gaussian Distribution</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                We initially experimented with using our own Sobel operations to find edges and keeping only the edges
                with the gradient magnitude above some threshold, but discovered that while Canny had more
                feature-filled output for some images, it was more consistent than our approach, so we decided to use
                the Canny Edge Detector.

            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Skeletonize</strong><br>
                As you can see in the example of Handsome Squidward above, Canny often finds “double edges” for all
                major borders, even when the borders are very tiny. We find the Medial Axis of the Canny output to try
                to get rid of some of these double borders (“Skeleton (Thin) above). However, there are often still
                regions with many densely populated edges that we want to simplify. So, we dilate every point circularly
                outward, causing some dense areas to merge, and then re-skeletonize. Skeletonization simplifies blobs
                into one-pixel-wide lines, which will be very useful for our slicing graph algorithms.
                <br><br>

                This gives us the final output of the image processing step, giving us the actual simplified image we
                wish to draw on paper. This is then passed into the path finder.

            <h3>Optimal Path Finding</h3>
            <p>
                We can see in the final skeletonized image that there are some discrete clusters that we can divide the
                image into. For example, Squidward’s head, mouth, and eyes are all discrete pieces. This means that we
                need to individually find the best route to travel between these pieces, and also find the best way to
                travel between them such that we minimize the amount of unnecessary white paper that we draw on (this
                adds additional lines not in the target processed photo).
                <br><br>

                <strong>1. Cluster Finding</strong><br>
                We use DBScan, a density-based clustering algorithm, to find these major groups. For each group, we
                reduce the group to a graph (network) data structure by creating a node for every pixel in each group,
                and attaching nodes to each other if they are within a one pixel distance.
                <br><br>

                <strong>2. Subgraph Construction</strong><br>
                Because our skeletonized image has a maximum width of 1 pixel for each edge, we know that every pixel on
                an edge in our photo has 1 (dead-end) or 2 neighbors, unless that pixel lies at the intersection of
                multiple edges. We create a subgraph from our original graph, where we consider these intersection
                points and dead-ends to be nodes, and all other points to be on edges connecting them. Additionally, we
                again merge very close points in this step into single nodes.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Optimal Traversal</strong><br>
                Now we need to find the optimal traversal of these subgraphs so that all edges are covered with minimal
                distance traveled. To do so, we do the following process:
                Convert each subgraph into a weighted graph, where each edge has weight based on the number of pixels in
                the edge.
                <br><br>

                Make a node order by doing Depth First Search (DFS) from the most top-left node, adding intermediate
                nodes inside of edges. The DFS priority is based on traveling to subtrees with minimal cost (this means
                that we will visit small branches, like whiskers on a cat or fingers on a hand, before large branches
                like arms), minimizing backtracking distance. For example, suppose we started at the top of squidward’s
                head and went to his shoulders before covering his connected eye. Then, we would need to do a large
                backtrace from the shoulders back to the eyes later, whereas covering his eye first minimizes the amount
                backtraced to get to his shoulders after.
                <br><br>

                Construct a path by traveling from node to node through the DFS order, skipping edges whose intermediate
                nodes have been traversed, and finding the shortest path from the current node to the next node through
                our subgraph using Dijstra’s algorithm. This has the effect of allowing the path to visit different
                edges if it is more efficient than backtracing.
                <br><br>


                Once an optimal traversal of each subgraph has been found, we find the best way to travel between them.
                Find the shortest distance between each pair of subgraphs (smallest distance between any two points).
                Do Prim’s algorithm to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST, a tree connecting all subgraphs which
                minimizes the overall distance between each subgraph).
                <br><br>

                Do DFS on the MST to find an order through which to visit the subgraphs.
                At each step in the path, follow the optimal traversal of the current subgraph, and then travel to the
                point on the subgraph closest to the next subgraph, and jump over to that subgraph with an extra line.
                <br><br>

                We made a simulation using Pygame which shows the result of this process:

            </div>

            <p>
                <br><br>

                <strong>Steps for Improvement</strong><br>
                After creating this process, we discovered that our problem is very similar to the solved Chinese
                Postman Problem, where the goal is to visit all edges in a graph (repetition allowed) with minimal
                distance. We could transform our problem into an instance of this problem by combining the subgraphs
                together using the MST into one big graph, that we would then use the solution algorithm for the Chinese
                Postman Problem on.
                <br><br>

                The final path is handed off to the Serial Communicator.
