            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                We developed an educational synthesizer device designed to simplify the learning process for new
                electronic musicians. The device features six knobs that adjust the sound envelope and frequency, a
                switch to toggle between sine and square waveforms, and a live VGA display that visualizes the current
                waveform, frequency spectrum, and envelope stage. Our motivation stemmed from the observation that most
                synthesizers are challenging for beginners, often requiring trial and error to understand their
                controls. By providing immediate audio and visual feedback, our device demystifies core synthesis
                concepts such as the ADSR envelope, frequency manipulation, and waveform differences, making sound
                design more accessible.

            <h2>High Level Design</h2>
            <p>
                In our design, we utilize two cores. Core 0 primarily runs a single thread and handles two interrupt
                service routines: one for receiving user input-where the user can rotate six potentiometers to adjust
                parameters-and another that triggers every 20 microseconds to compute values and send them to the DAC
                module via SPI transactions. Core 1 runs a separate thread that is primarily responsible for VGA signal
                generation.

                <h2>Rationale and Sources</h2>
                <p>
                    Synthesizers are notoriously difficult for beginners due to their abstract controls and lack of
                    intuitive feedback. While high-end synthesizers may include small displays for envelope
                    visualization, entry-level and DIY models typically offer only labeled knobs and buttons, which can
                    be confusing. Our project aims to bridge this gap by combining tactile controls with clear visual
                    feedback, introducing users to essential synthesis concepts like attack, decay, sustain, and release
                    (ADSR).

            <h2>Background Math</h2>
            <p>
                There are four stages in generating an ADSR signal: Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Attack:</strong> In the attack stage, we use an exponential function to shape the amplitude
                    over time. The mathematical formulation is:<br>
                    <div style="margin-left:2em;">
                        <span style="font-family: serif; font-size: 1.1em;">
                            <code>Amplitude<sub>t</sub> = 1 &minus; exp(&minus;t / &tau;)</code>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    The constant &tau; in the attack stage determines the rate at which the amplitude increases. We will
                    discuss how this value is chosen in a later section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Decay:</strong> In the decay stage, we use a linear function to shape the amplitude over
                    time. The mathematical formulation is:<br>
                    <div style="margin-left:2em;">
                        <span style="font-family: serif; font-size: 1.1em;">
                            <code>Amplitude<sub>t</sub> = Amplitude<sub>t-1</sub> &minus; (Max_Attack_Amplitude / Decay_Time)<br>
         Amplitude<sub>t</sub> = max(Amplitude<sub>t</sub>, Sustain_Level)</code>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    The maximum attack amplitude is determined based on the amplitude reached at the end of the attack
                    stage. The decay duration is set according to user input. If the computed amplitude falls below the
                    user-defined sustain level, it is clamped to the sustain level to ensure stability in the envelope.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sustain:</strong> In the sustain stage, the amplitude is held constant at the user-defined
                    sustain level. The mathematical formulation is:<br>
                    <div style="margin-left:2em;">
                        <span style="font-family: serif; font-size: 1.1em;">
                            <code>Amplitude<sub>t</sub> = Sustain_Level</code>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    Both the sustain level and the sustain duration are determined based on user input.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Release:</strong> In the release stage, the amplitude decreases linearly from the sustain
                    level to zero over a duration defined by the user-specified release time.<br>
                    <div style="margin-left:2em;">
                        <span style="font-family: serif; font-size: 1.1em;">
                            <code>Amplitude<sub>t</sub> = Amplitude<sub>t-1</sub> &minus; (Sustain_Level / Release_Time)</code>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    Both the sustain level and the release time are determined based on user input.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We applied both sine and square waveforms as the base signals that pass through the ADSR envelope to
                demonstrate the system’s versatility in shaping different types of input signals. Only one waveform is
                used at a time, and the user can select between sine and square waveforms via a switch input.

            <h2>Logical Structure &amp; Software Architecture</h2>
            <h3>Thread Responsibilities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Input Thread:</strong> In this thread, six switches are used to allow the user to
                    select which parameter to adjust—namely, attack time, decay time, sustain time, sustain level,
                    release time, and frequency. An additional switch enables the user to choose between a sine wave or
                    a square wave as the base waveform. Six potentiometers are available to provide analog input, which
                    are read by the system in real time. The thread continuously monitors the switch states to identify
                    the active parameter and then reads the corresponding potentiometer value to update that parameter
                    dynamically.</li>
                <li><strong>VGA Thread:</strong> In the VGA thread, an animation is displayed to indicate the current
                    stage of the ADSR envelope—Attack, Decay, Sustain, or Release. Additionally, the current amplitude
                    and output frequency are shown on the screen in real time, enhancing user engagement and
                    interaction. This thread continuously updates the display with the latest information to reflect
                    system behavior accurately.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</h3>
            <p>
                The timer-based interrupt service routine (ISR) on core 0 handles the system’s core audio generation and
                operates as a state machine implementing the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope. </p>
            <img src="ISR.png" alt="ISR state Diagram" class="centered">
            <p>The state machine includes two main stages: STATE_0 = 0, which generates sound, and STATE_0 = 1, which remains
                silent. A counter continuously increments within the ISR and triggers a state transition when it reaches
                a predefined threshold—resetting the counter and switching to the alternate stage.</p>

            <p>In STATE_0 = 0, which is responsible for producing sound, the ISR calculates the amplitude using parameters
                obtained from the user input thread. Based on the current counter value, it performs exponential growth
                during the Attack phase, linear decay toward the user-defined Sustain level during the Decay phase,
                maintains the amplitude in the Sustain phase, and applies a linear decrease during the Release phase.
                The amplitude is then used in a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) routine to generate the waveform, either
                sine or square, according to user selection, and the result is transmitted to the DAC via SPI for audio
                output. </p>


            <h3>Inter-thread Communication</h3>
            <p>
                All threads share global variables such as attack time, decay time, sustain time, sustain level, release
                time, and frequency, which are safely updated by the input thread and read by the ISR and VGA threads.
            </p>
            <h3>Overall Software Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core 0:</strong> Runs audio ISR and real-time synthesis</li>
                <li><strong>Core 1:</strong> Manages user input and VGA display threads</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hardware/Software Tradeoffs</h3>
            <p>
                The Raspberry Pi Pico we used provides only three analog inputs, but our design required six
                potentiometers. To address this, we implemented a manual multiplexing solution using double-throw
                switches: two switches per potentiometer pair-one to send a high/low signal to a GPIO pin and another to
                select between potentiometer wipers for the analog input. Although unconventional and somewhat
                confusing, this approach allowed us to meet our design goals within our time constraints.
            </p>
            <p>We initially planned to use an MCP3008 ADC to expand our analog inputs, but we encountered difficulties
                finding reliable libraries and did not have time to write our own driver. Given our concurrent
                commitments to other projects, we opted for the manual multiplexing approach, which, while unorthodox,
                proved effective and even enjoyable from a hardware-hacking perspective.</p>

                For example, to adjust the sustain level (labeled in blue), the user should rotate the potentiometer and set both switches to the correct position.</p>
            <p>
                Our device uses six 10kΩ potentiometers with infinite rotation for a smooth tactile experience. The
                enclosure is
                a custom laser-cut structure made from medium-density fiberboard (MDF). Each potentiometer's diameter
                was
                measured and slightly enlarged in CAD to ensure a proper fit, along with a hole for the small protrusion
                on the
                potentiometer which later will provide rigidity. The layout places four knobs on the top panel and two
                on the
                bottom, all evenly spaced. The side panels are triangular, forming a wedge-shaped housing, while the
                back panel
                features a large notch for cable management. The enclosure is spacious enough to accommodate the
                breadboard and
                Raspberry Pi Pico, though for ease of debugging, the electronics were kept external during development.
                The
                panels were assembled using wood glue. The potentiometers were inserted to the holes and the notches
                aligned,
                then the nuts that came with the potentiometers were secured on top of the panel such that the
                potentiometer
                shafts could spin without the body spinning. Knob caps were pushed onto each potentiometer shaft for
                ease of
                use. The knobs also allow for finer adjustment of each potentiometer because of their larger diameter.

            <p>
                The software component was responsible for generating the sound, handling user input from the
                potentiometers and switches, and rendering the real-time waveform and frequency displays via VGA. The
                most challenging aspect of the code was accurately implementing the decay phase of the ADSR envelope,
                which required careful timing and state management. Since the decay phase transitions into the sustain
                level rather than decaying to zero, it requires precise timing and careful state management.
                Additionally, due to time constraints within the interrupt service routine (ISR), it was crucial to
                minimize the decay computation time to avoid delays that could disrupt real-time performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through repeated testing, we ultimately chose to implement a linear decay, tuning its parameters
                empirically to strike a balance between responsiveness and envelope accuracy.

            <h2>ADSR Envelope Parameter Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                In our system, we implement a standard four-stage ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope. The
                parameters for each stage are carefully chosen based on empirical testing and auditory evaluation to
                ensure a natural and responsive user experience.

            <h3>Parameter Settings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Constant (τ):</strong> Set to 1500 in the attack stage, determines the rate of
                    exponential amplitude increase</li>
                <li><strong>Stage Durations (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release):</strong> Controlled by user input (via
                    potentiometers), constrained to the range of 200 to 35,500 interrupt cycles to ensure system

            <h2>Switch and Potentiometer Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                We use a total of seven switches and six potentiometers in our system to provide full user control over
                sound synthesis parameters. One switch is dedicated to toggling between sine and square waveform
                outputs. The remaining six switches are divided into two functional groups of three.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the RP2040's limitation of only three ADC input pins, we implemented a clever configuration:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Three switches are used to indicate which of the six parameters (attack time, decay time, sustain
                    time, sustain level, release time, frequency) the user wants to adjust.</li>
                <li>The other three switches serve as a 'multiplexer' control to determine which potentiometer's analog
                    signal is routed to the ADC input at a given time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This design allows us to effectively control six parameters with only three ADC channels, making
                efficient use of limited hardware resources.

                Our project builds upon sample code provided in the Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos repository. Specifically,
                we
                referenced and adapted the c_Audio_Beep_Synthesis_Single_Core example from the Audio section to
                implement and
                extend our own audio synthesis framework.

                    unable to find a working software library in time, leading us to implement manual multiplexing with

            <p>Elise did the majority of wiring the system, and debugging hardware aspects. She designed and made the
                housing. She also defined the scope of the actual teaching synth because she came in with more
                experience with synthesizers. Elise did research on the math of each envelope stage. She came up with
                the idea to replace the ADC with a 'multiplexer' of switches. She drew the wiring diragram and completed
                the html site.
            </p>
            <p>Peng Ru did the majority of the coding, including reading ADC values, interpreting switch outputs, performing the mathematical computations for generating sound and displaying it on the VGA screen, and testing the synthesizer parameters. 
                For the webpage, Peng Ru completed the high-level design, background math, software architecture, and program details.</p>
