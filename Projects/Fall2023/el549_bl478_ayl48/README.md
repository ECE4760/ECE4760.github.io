# ECE 4760 Final Project: Theremin With 3D Image
## Project Introduction

Dive into a unique audiovisual experience as you interact with our project: a theremin that 
controls the movement of a floating cube. 

The theremin works by using an ultrasonic distance sensor which measures the distance of 
the user’s hand, through the detection of sound pulses, subsequently altering the sound 
based on the measured distance.  

Then, based on the distance, we would change the amplitude and frequency of the sound wave 
we were synthesizing to produce a new sound.

Using pepper’s ghost effect, we projected an image of a cube that rotates about both the x 
and y axes onto a 45-degree angled plastic pane called a pepper’s ghost reflector. The cube 
rotates clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the direction of our hand’s motion in 
front of the distance sensor. 

Concurrently, users hear varying sounds and observe changes in the cube’s rotation in 
response to the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
