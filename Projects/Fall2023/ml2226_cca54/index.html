        <p>
          How&#39;s your memorization? <br>
          Try out our memorization game using 2 Raspberry Pi Pico Ws
          and wireless communication through UDP!
        </p>

        <p>
          For our final project, we decided to make a Wi-Fi-based video game
          inspired by a popular children&#39;s game Simon Says. This is a two player
          game, using both LEDs and buttons in front of the player and also a
          VGA screen to visually keep track of the game. We chose this final
          project because we have been exposed to different communication
          protocols but never had any exposure to Wi-Fi and we believed that
          this was a cool way to explore it. We specifically used the Raspberry
          Pi Pico W’s as our microcontroller and used the lwip library to send
          data via Wi-Fi. This was done with access to this library and using
          User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

      <!-- High Level Design -->
      <section id="high-level-design">
        <h2>High Level Design</h2>
        <p>
          The rationale behind Pico Says was to have two Picos to communicate
          with each other using a sequence of LED lights. Each Pico is connected
          to 4 LEDs and their corresponding buttons and VGA screen. To pick the
          playing, either player can press the reset button to go first, or the
          send button to go second. Player One will press whatever LED of their
          choice to start the sequence. Player Two will see it on their board
          and repeat the sequence that they saw and add onto it. This keeps
          going back and forth until one player messes it up. Each player has
          three lives before they lose the game. How many lives, the accuracy of
          the sequence you sent, and whether it is your turn is all displayed on
          the VGA screen.
        </p>

        <img src="images/udp.png" />

        <p>
          There were some software tradeoffs as for the Wi-Fi communication
          protocol we used was UDP which was a lot easier to implement between
          the two Picos but had very little error checking so data can sometimes
          get lost after being sent to each board. The other option was TCP
          (Transmission Control Protocol) which ensures that the correct data
          will always be sent and received but it was a lot harder to implement.

      <!-- Program/Hardware Design -->
      <section id="program-hardware-design">
        <h2>Hardware Design</h2>

        <p>
          From the hardware perspective, we had to switch microcontrollers for
          the Raspberry Pi Pico to the Raspberry Pi Pico W in order to use the
          Wi-Fi capabilities. The pinouts of the boards are very similar which
          made this transition easier. We soldered the four LEDs, their
          respective buttons, and the REST and SEND buttons to prototype boards
        </p>

        <img src="images/circuit_2.jpeg" />

        <p>
          As seen above, the order of the LEDs were red, green, and blue. They
          are each connected to 330 ohm resistors. The bottom two buttons are
          REST and SEND respectively. REST allows a player to start over if they
          feel like they made a mistake entering the sequence and once you are
          done you send the data using SEND. These buttons also double as
          indicating the play order at the beginning of the game. If you select
          RESET, you are going first. If you select SEND, you are playing
          second. Because we are using two Picos, we had to double everything to
          make sure they looked identical and the wirings were the same.
        </p>

        <img src="images/circuit_1.jpeg" />

        <p>
          Also connected to the Pico W was a VGA screen to show wheter it was a 
          player&#39;s turn, how many lives were left and the end game result. 
          The VGA protocol manipulates two digital synchronization pins and three analog color 
          pins (RED, GREEN, and BLUE) One of the synchronization pins, HSYNC, 
          tells the screen when to move to a new row of pixels. The other synchronization pin, VSYNC, 
          tells the screen when to start a new frame. For VGA to work we need send 25MHz red, green, blue 
          signals through the protocol. The state machine initializes counting registers and waits for a 
          signal from the VSYNC state machine to start sending pixel data. When active, it clocks out 640 
          pixels, outputting 3 bits at a time with the required delays. After a row is complete, it resets 
          and waits for the VSYNC signal. With this protocol, we can now use DMA to communicate pixel data. 
          How this works is that there is a global character array named vga_data_array holds color data 
          for pairs of adjacent pixels. This data is sent to the RGB PIO state machine 8 bits at a time 
          through a DMA channel. The DMA channel is synchronized with the PIO machine using the DREQ_PIO0_TX2 
          data request signal. Another DMA channel, chained to the first, then resets and reconfigures the first channel.
          We implement the software by using DMA to send signals for pixel data. Functions for these have been prewritten 
          in the VGA Driver Library, so we just need to use those methods in our code.
        </p>

        <h2>Software Design</h2>

        <p>
          In all three labs we were exposed to SPI, UART and I2C as
          communication protocols. However, all these protocols required the
          Picos to be wired together. It would be cool to talk and send data
          without being confined to a single breadboard. Thus, the idea of using
          Wi-Fi was introduced.
        </p>

        <p>
          This semester we used the Raspberry Pico as our microcontroller. In
          order to use Wi-Fi capabilities, we had to move to the Pico W. The
          pinouts of the boards are very similar. Once we had our board, we
          learned that Wi-Fi has its variety of ways to communicate data. The
          two main ones we considered were UDP and TCP. We decided to use UDP
          because it was easier to implement and we had example code from
          Instructor Bruce Land to start from.
        </p>

        <img src="images/result_serial.jpeg" />

        <h3>Wi-Fi Implemention</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned, we used example code to frame how the code would be organized. 
          We organized our code into 5 threads:
          <ol>
            <li> UDP Send
              <p> This is how each Pico W sends the sequence the players inputs as an array of integers 1-4 
                <br>(1 = RED, 2 = GREEN, 3 = YELLOW, 4 = BLUE). It is only used when it is signaled to by the Signals
                Thread. The majority of this code was from example code listed in our references.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>UDP Receive
              <p> This takes the incoming sequence from the other picos and translates the array into LED
                flashes. This thread also checks if the recieved sequence was accuarate before it was added 
                to. The majority of this code was from example code listed in our references. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Blink cyw43 LED
              <p>This thread is a visual way to represenet if the Pico W&#39;s are in pairing mode. Since we used
                a hotspot instead of making one of the Pico&#39;s a station. We had to wait from both microcontrollers
                lights to flicker prior to playing the game otherwise data will not be sent nor recieved. This 
                compatible to the LWIP library
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> Serial
              <p> This allowed us to see before we draw anything on the VGA screens if the Picos were effectively 
                communicating with each other. It also ensures they are both connected to the same hotspot. If not data 
                can not be send nor recieved.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li> Signals
              <p> This controlled all the button presses and LED flashes based on the inputs from the palyer themselves
                or that that was received from the other board. It is also where sequences are sent to the UDP send thread 
                using the SEND button or its clear using RESET. The logic behind signal data transmission happened in here.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          We designed the app so that there are three different states of the
          game. This is to simplify the process of knowing what to send, We have
          a player selection state, a game play state, and an end game state.
          These three each contribute to how data is manipulated to send the
          correct data and to know what type of data to receive.
        </p>

        <h3>Player Selection State:</h3>
        <p>
          This state is the starting menu for the game. The design for this
          screen is quite simple as it gives each player an overview of the
          game, a picture of the hardware that is used to play the game and a
          quick instruction on how to start the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to start the game, the player needs to either press to RESET
          button or SEND button. Player selection is first come first serve,
          where if one person wants P1 and they press the RESET button, the
          other player that has not selected a player will be defaulted to P2.
        </p>

        <img src="images/enter_screen.jpeg" />

        <p>
          The reason for this choice is because we did not want to run into
          problems where both players wanted to start first. Or a possibility
          would be to have both players decide beforehand who wants to receive
          or who wants to send a sequence first. This might be more difficult as
          we would need to implement a condition or state when both people
          playing would accidentally both select the same starting player.
        </p>

        <p>
          As mentioned previously, the udp send and receive sequence is
          dependent state of the game. In this state of the game, we will still
          send a sequence but only the first index of the sequence is used. This
          first index is used to send the correct player number to the other
          pico. The other pico will then determine which player it is, and which
          is the other player.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code 
              >memcpy(otherPlayer, recv_data, send_data_size);
              if (otherPlayer == 2) { 
                player = 1; mode = send; 
              } else {
                player = 2; mode = echo; 
              }
              start_game = true;
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Once both players receive the respectful player numbers, we can signal
          to both picos that the game is ready to start
        </p>

        <h3>Game Playing State</h3>

        <p>
          With a completely new state, we can set start_game = true. This is so
          that we can change what to check within our sequence. The game state
          makes it a little more difficult to know what to send or receive.
          Given the instructions of the game, we need to track quite a few
          things. Which move each player is on, and what is the most recent
          sequence that was sent or received.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given that state tracking within the pico itself might cause
          complexity issues between which player is moving and which player
          isn’t, we decided to modify the data sent to account for two
          instructions: the current move that needs to be played and the entered
          in sequence. This allows the program to continuously alternate between
          the players without having to keep track of which move its at. This is
          important because it tells the player how many moves to make, which
          should be one more of the length of the last received sequence.
        </p>

        <p>
          We accomplished this by using the first index to store the move turn
          and the rest of the data array to store the game sequence. A picture
          of the udp data array is shown below.
        </p>

        <img src="images/data_array.png" alt="UDP Data Array" />

        <h3>Game Logic:</h3>

        <p>
          The most important part is the game logic as each pico figures out its
          own sequence. We created helper functions to make the process easier.
          We have a function called sequenceLED(int seq), so that the receiving
          player can memorize and enter in the correct sequence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another helper function is compare_sequences(const int *seq1, const
          int *seq2). This helper function helps check whether or not the
          received sequence is the same as the entered in sequence. Given the
          entered sequence will always have a length greater than the received
          sequence, we need to also check the condition whether the
          sequence[index] is 0. The data array will be initialized with 0s and
          thats how we’ll know which sequence index to check up to.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since UDP does not have an acknowledgement system and we ran out of
          time for TCP/IP, we decided to not send an extra packet just to tell
          the other player whether we got it correct. Our strategy was again, to
          use the data array to our advantage. Since move turn is always greater
          or equal to 1, we can use the first index value to tell the other
          player whether or not they themselves got the sequence correct. This
          means that within the background, each pico checks whether its own
          player entered in the correct corresponding sequence.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code
            >for (int i = 0; i < data_size; i++) { 
              printf("%d ", received_data_obj.sequence[i]);
              sequenceLED(received_data_obj.sequence[i]); 
            } 
            // i think here we can check if data received shows that the opponent didn't get it correct
            if (received_data_obj.sequence[0] == 0) // incorrect sequence {
              otherLives--; // reset send sequence memset(send_data, 0,
              UDP_MSG_LEN_MAX); memcpy(send_data, data_obj.sequence,
              send_data_size); 
            }
              </code
            >
        </pre>

        <p>
          We also need to check whether or not players are clicking or doing the
          right thing at the right time. With the help of states and another
          helper function to check the entered in sequence length, we can
          control what buttons the player can press and when to press it.
          There’s also a reset button to reset the entered in sequence if you’ve
          messed up.
        </p>

        <h3>VGA Graphics:</h3>

        <p>
          We added in a draw heart function to visualize the number of lives
          each user had left. We used some simple calculation to get the general
          shape using two circles and a rounded rectangle. With predefined
          values for radius, width, and height, we were able to position and add
          in the according shapes to represent a red heart.
        </p>

        <img src="images/lives.png" />

        <p>
          Given that each user has 2-3 lives to start with, depending on how the
          game wants to be played, drawLives use used to space out the hearts
          for each of the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Features</h3>

        <p>
          A cool feature we wanted to add in was some sort of visual feature
          with the VGA screen. Something to tell the players which LED buttons
          they’ve pressed thus far. This is so that if the game ever gets to a
          sequence length of 10+, then it’ll help the players out. They might
          even forget which ones they’ve pressed thus far. HAHA. And we also
          need an instructional screen to tell which player is supposed to move
          or receive. All that needs to be done is after every move, we reset
          the player screen based off of new updated data.
        </p>

        <img src="images/result_screen.jpeg" />

        <h3>End Game State</h3>

        <p>
          The end game state is quite simple as all we need to do is to check
          when either player’s lives is 0. But how do we know when the other
          player has 0 lives if we never send that requirement through packets?
          Well, as mentioned earlier we use the first index to send whether or
          not a player has entered a correct sequence. Once that incorrect flag
          is checked, the pico stores the lives of the other player. So, once a
          player loses all three lives, the player itself knows that it loses
          and the other player knows that it wins. Both VGA screens will adjust
          to the corresponding end game screen.
        </p>

        <h2>Results of the Design and Demo</h2>
        <p>
          Our final project was actually really fun to play! We sat on opposite
          benches with the VGAs turned away so we could not  cheat and played a
          couple rounds of Pico Says. The biggest issue was the Wi-Fi not
          sending the data consistently but when it did the game worked very
          well. It is pretty straightforward, the instructions are on the VGA
          screen if one were to ever get confused or wondering if their sequence
          was sent to the other player. When the data was being sent accurately,
          it was cool to see the LEDs of the different boards light up in
          correspondence to what was sent. The biggest thing we notice it that our
          accuarcy was not that good. Even after confirming that the microcontrollers
          were paired to the same hotspot, sometimes data still would not send but if 
          you refesh the game it would working perfectly fine. We had to make the boards
          pretty close to the hotspot to enfore udp packets were not getting lost. Also the 
          fact that the lab, which has a lot of desktops, made the enevironemnt noisy and 
          more likely to lose data packets.

      <!-- Conclusions -->
      <section id="conclusions">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          Compared to our final project proposal, we did not meet all our
          expectations. We planned on adding sound effects for each button using a DAC, audio
          jack and SPI and a timer using an Interrupt Service Routine for each player to increase competition. 
          However, we did not have enough time to implement the timer and although we did implement
          sound effects, we did not have the time to debug and fix it before our
          final demo. Figuring out the Wi-Fi capacilies took more time than we planned.
          If we could add more to our game, we would have added those features and also having different difficulty levels to
          challenge players even more. Even to add more picos/players to the
          game to make it more challenging. If we could make more improvements, using a Wi-Fi
          protocol that has error checking lessen the likelihood of having data packet loss would be intesting to explore as well. 
          <br>
          As for intellectual property consideration, we have not seen any project that resembles our own.
          Although we did use some example code, aside from that our code is original and our own and our
          project is consistent with IEEE Code of Ethics.
