<p>Let’s bring back the childhood memories through our own arcade game console!</p>

<p>New video games are released every day, and there are countless creative ways to enjoy them: gamepads and large monitors, laptops, portable game consoles, VR, etc. The way that games become more and more creative and utilize advanced technology is all thanks to the very first video games—the pioneers of the video game world. For this project, we wanted to create our own arcade game console with some classic retro video games that we used to play when we were young, to cherish our childhood days.</p>

<p>The games that we chose to implement are Pong, Snake, and Memory, which is our original memory test game. These games are explained further in details in the High Level Design and Software Design pages.

<p>Here is a demo video in which we briefly walked through how our game console operates and what games we implemented.</p>
