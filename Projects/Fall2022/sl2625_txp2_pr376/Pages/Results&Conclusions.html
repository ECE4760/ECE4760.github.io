	<br>The user chooses a particular game to play from the main menu. Based on their choice, the game is invoked on the LCD screen, and they can play the selected game using control buttons for movement. <br>
	<br>There is also a scoring mechanism on the right top corner of the screen. The game was altered to “end” by pressing the back button on the bottom left button of the gameboy to return back to the main menu. Sound effects were implemented so the buzzer can generate them during each game. Multiplayer gaming options were also implemented. <br>
	<br>The player can visualize the game being played using the control buttons on the LCD screen with real time graphics and sound effects (that were implemented using the buzzer). Additionally, a game over message is displayed if the player boy dies during the game. <br>
	<br>The latency between button input and player movement was minimized pretty well, and synchronization of sound effects with the game was also consistent. The player gets real time graphical  feedback, however there are some rare situations where buttons may not function well, which may cause some problems in movement of the player boy.  <br>
	<br>We implemented a menu-based interactive video game system that is fun to use and easy to play with. It uses the micropython library with proven performance and speed, along with recent electronics parts. The overall performance of the system is also pretty interactive and can also be scalable to multiplayer scenarios conveniently. Synchronization of multiplayer movements is also efficient. This has been accompanied with suitable sound effects and graphics. <br> 
	<br>The games accuracy is high, as immediate selection of the buttons that control each game, is immediately responsive on the LCD screen. There is no signs of lagging or hesitation during  game play from the control buttons and game play such as “invaders” show quick results where the lasers shot will “kill” an alien”. Having efficient interactiveness can create a better experience for players allowing them to have deeper immersion.<br>
	<br>The design of this game is quite safe.The current system has no safety requirements as no personal details of the players are used or shared with other players or via the internet. The game also poses no physical risk to the player. The only concern could be overheating of the LCD, and may be hot to touch, but this would only happen after a long period of time. This also goes for potential damage to eyes if given enough exposure during gaming. There are currently only 3 games, so gaming experience would be quite short and would likely not pose these risks. <br>
	<br>To receive user input, our team asked different people what their thoughts were on the game after playing. There were specific comments on how the snake game people are generally used to having the snake wrap around if it exits the screen so the snake would continuously be playable and return to “eat” its food. So, instead of having the game end when the snake touches the screen’s edge, we adjusted the code to allow the snake to wrap around. Another feedback was when playing the invaders game, the laser being released to attack the spaceship and aliens was quite tiny and users had a difficult time visualizing them, so the size of that was increased. Users also preferred to have control over shooting two lasers at a time in order to attack more aliens, so the amount of lasers were changed instead of keeping a single laser at a time.<br>

	<br>In this project we learned how to build an interactive single/multiplayer game system from scratch using recent software and hardware technologies and electronics. We ensured that all the games were easily visualized and implemented and were using a compatible codebase across all games. Additionally, we tried to make the overall design seamless and easy-to-use.<br>
	<br>This gaming system can be scaled to multi-player (currently two players are supported) implementations, and more efficient synchronization constructs can be used in such a situation. Additionally, better and more interactive graphics and touchscreen (not manual) controls can be incorporated. Sound effects can be more varied and modulated. Each game can have multiple difficulty levels. A bigger and more seamless design can be implemented. Furthermore, more than 3 games could be potentially added and the overall cost to put the system together is quite cheap (around $25 and below). Therefore, if someone were to look at the provided code and would like to implement their own game they can do so easily.  The results indicated good performance with respect to visualization, sound effects, feedback graphics, scalability to multi-player scenarios, multi-game options, similar to codebase and libraries, simple and robust.<br> 
	<br>A standard gameboy should be able to follow controls and navigate the game environment efficiently while making progress in the game. It should be able to move around in the entire playscreen, and follow instructions. Additionally, the gaming system must be robust enough to produce good graphics and sound effects in real-time. <br>
	<br>For intellectual property considerations, we made adjustments and improvements to two main source codes from public domains  listed in the references section. However, their codes as discussed in the optimization section, could not run properly due to flickering and utilization of an SSD1306 driver, so a new ili9341 library was created to incorporate FrameBuffer for smooth gaming experience. No non-disclosure had to be signed to receive sample parts and all wiring of the pico to the TFT display were demonstrated through datasheets. <br>
	<br>Since multiple gaming systems such as XBox, Nintendo, PlayStation etc. that are more interactive and offering a wider range of controls already exist, this design cannot be patented, but currently serves as a beginner level prototype of these existing systems. In addition, this project can be served as a beginner friendly learning experience for those who are interested in learning how gaming systems work and how to create a microcontroller system from scratch.</p>
