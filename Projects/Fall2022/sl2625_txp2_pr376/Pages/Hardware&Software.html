<div class="home-card-wrapper2">
<br>The hardware of this lab involves RP2040 microcontroller, ILI9341 display and a buzzer as depicted in Figure 1.<br>
<br>The RP2040 is a 32-bit dual ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller integrated circuit clocked at 133 MHz with 264 KB internal SRAM and 2MB internal flash storage. It is designed to encompass ultra-low power consumption, reliable I/O, can be powered by 3.3V, and supports various communication protocols such as PWM, ADC, UART, I2C and SPI. RP2040 can thoroughly be programmed in both MicroPython and C/C++.<br>

<br>The ILI9341 is a 262, 144-color single chip SOC driver for a-TFT liquid crystal display (LCD) consisting of 240RGBx320 resolution. It is capable of supporting the following: (1)  parallel 8,9, 16 or 18 bit data bus MCU interface, (2)  6,16, or 18 bit data bus for the RGB interface and (3) 3 or 4 line serial peripheral interface (SPI)<sup>2</sup>. To fully operate, it can work with interface voltage (I/O) ranging from 1.65V to 3.3V. It consists of an integrated voltage follower circuit in order to produce voltage levels for driving an LCD and it also supports full color display and sleep mode for optimal performance control by software<sup>2</sup>. These features allow the device to be an ideal LCD driver for small to mediun portable devices where long battery life could be a concern.<br>

<div class="home-card-wrapper2">
<br>As shown in Figure 3, the ili9341 encompasses four different MCU system interface with a 8080-I and 8080-II series parallel interface together with a 3-/4-line serial interface. The ili9341is capable of supporting RGB interface for showing moving animations on a display. When the RGB interface is selected, the operation of the display is then synchronized with external signals such as VSYNC, HSYNC and DOTCLK, while the display for input data is written in synchronization with these signals depending on the polarity of the enabled signal (DE). The GRAM seen in the block diagram performs as the graphic RAM to manage and store display data. The GRAM’s size is 172,800 bytes with 18 bits per pixel for a maximum 240(RGB) by 320 dot graphic display. The grayscale voltage generating circuit provides a LCD voltage that will interact to the grayscale level set within the gamma correction register. As a result, the ili9341 can display up to 262,144 colors. Then, the LCD drive power supply circuit produces the voltage levels through GVDD, VGH, VGL and VCOM in order to supply the TFT LCD panel. The timing controller will help assist in producing each timing signals for the display and GRAM to access. The ili9341 also encompasses an RC oscillator circuit, which outputs a stable frequency to operate. The panel driver circuit for LCD encompasses 720-output source driver ranging from S1 to S720, a 320-output gate driver ranging from G1 to G320 and a VCOM signal.<br>
<br>The buzzer used is to demonstrate beeps, alerts and tones during gameplay. Passive buzzers work well with smaller projects that are unable to amplify power, which saves power. The dimensions of it is 0.89 by 0.89 by 0.31 inches and encompasses the following features: rated impedance - 8±15%, max power - 0.5W, resonant frequency - 1500±20%Hz, sound output - 80 at 0.1W 10cm 1.5kHz and operating temperature - -20~+60C.<br>
