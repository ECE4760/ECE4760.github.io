	The purpose of this final project is to develop a functional videogame console for playing simple games in retro or arcade style. Before modern technology took over, classic games such as pac-man became the pioneer of gameplay and game design. Today video games continue to be popular as they provide players with the opportunity to be entertained in a simulated interactive setting and make meaningful decisions in relation to playing the game. However, game development can be an extremely challenging, tricky and time consuming process. One of the biggest advantages when creating a game is to have good libraries to support animations and responses. Python is capable of supporting many of these necessary libraries. Therefore, MicroPython will be the foundation for the code to program the RP2040 Pi Pico. This website will describe the detailed operational processes to reach our final product including how these processes were configured, and how the display was communicated with the pico.
