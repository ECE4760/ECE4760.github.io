<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>For our project, we made a game inspired by Guitar Hero. However, rather than taking button press inputs that become
	the sound on the other end based on if the right button is pressed, we decided to take the actually detected note
	frequency as input and check that for correctness. This means the game is essentially testing your ability to play the
	song in the right pitch and timing with a Guitar Hero display format. First, we tried to conceptually develop this
	project in both how it would look and function, going off of our understanding of music and how Guitar Hero plays.
	Then we sequentially designed the aspects of the game until we had a final result, starting with a serial input
	version of Guitar Hero that used the 1-9 keys for button input and VGA display. Once that was done we implemented the
	frequency check using an FFT to make the final version of our game, and add songs to that.</p>
