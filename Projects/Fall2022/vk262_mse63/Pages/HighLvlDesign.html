<p>High-Level Design:
  Our game is made up of three core components, the display on the VGA, the Frequency input from a microphone, and the
  logic of the game itself. To help with coherency we combined a lot of the display and logic data together since they
  were so related. Of course, we were partially inspired by the Game Guitar Hero, and also took advantage Prof. Land’s
  pseudocode on how to make a cepstrum (FFT of an FFT). We also used a reference table on how musical notes correlate in
  value to their respective frequencies. </p>
<br>
<h2 id="math-involved-">Math Involved:</h2>
<p>The only math involved in our project is from when we capture frequency information from the instrument data picked
  up on our microphone. The base of this system is the same FFT code we used from the cricket chirp lab, where the
  microphone records amplitude data and the code performs an FFT to get the spectrum of frequencies detected. This
  caused an issue for us though since we were using instruments, as these instruments produce extra frequencies on
  multiples of the fundamental note frequency that are also picked up on the FFT. We solved this on Prof. Land’s
  suggestion by applying a cepstrum rather than just an FFT. To do this we applied the FFTfix function from the cricket
  lab and used the extracted real and imaginary outputs, then combined these to get a real frequency magnitude spectrum.
  We take the log of this to get into the log power spectrum. By performing another FFT on this dataset and combining
  the real and imaginary outputs again we get the cepstrum, which only returns fundamental frequencies detected allowing
  us to use it to detect notes from instruments. The max amplitude fundamental frequency detected corresponded to the
  pitch we chose as the detected for the game. One additional note is that we added a DC component (zero frequency peak)
  right before the second FFT to improve the fundamental frequency detection as it made the patterned spacing of the
  notes easier for the program to detect and correct.</p>
<br>
<p>Once the frequency was detected we had to correlate that pitch to the note it was closest to. This is where we
  applied the table correlating the notes in several octaves to the frequencies they correspond to. We focused on the
  pitches we were interested in for our game, and made an equation that captured the frequencies in that range and
  converting them to a 1-24 range corresponding to the 24 notes in the two octaves we were interested in. Since the
  notes have an exponential relationship to the frequency this model has perfect precision, and is shown below:
  num = (int)(log(max_frequency / 493.88) / log(1.05946297692) + 0.5)
  First, the frequency detected is divided by the frequency of the lowest pitch in our two octaves, a C note at 493.88
  Hz. We take the log of this to convert the exponential relationship to a linear one and divide by log(1.05946297692)
  to convert it into the correct log base. Finally, we add 0.5 and convert it to an int. This allows us to round to the
  nearest viable note, where 1 is the lowest registered and 24 is the highest note. Any notes outside this range go
  unregistered in the game. </p>
<br>
<h2 id="core-logic-">Core Logic:</h2>
<p>Our game is based around a state machine to allow players to select a song and difficulty. The first state
  corresponds to the home screen where the player can select the song they want from a choice of 3. Buttons attached by
  GPIO to the RP2040 allow the player to toggle between songs and select the one they want to play. Next, a difficulty
  page is navigated in the same way. This page has 4 difficulties that alter the speed the notes descend the screen,
  with each higher difficulty being twice the speed of the last. Once the difficulty is selected the last state is
  entered where the actual game is run. </p>

<br>
<p>To start the VGA is updated with the fixed frame of the game and the initial values of accuracy, the internal timer,
  and the detected note are displayed in the corner. Next, the cepstrum is performed to see if a viable is note
  detected, which will be displayed on the screen as user input if that is the case. The rest of the data is based on
  the song selected, whose information is stored in an array that contains the notes in order in the 1-24 notation of
  the two octaves, their respective timings based on the difficulty, and a zero array that is updated based on user
  accuracy. The notes are displayed in the column that matches their note value of the 24 available. Their vertical
  position is based on the difference of the current time to the display time, meaning as the internal clock increments
  the notes slowly descend the screen as their y value increases. Once they are in a certain range the user input will
  be checked to see if it matches the note, and if so the value of the correct array corresponding to that note is
  updated to a 1, meaning correct. If the note passes through the window without being marked as correct, the array
  value is changed to -1, meaning incorrect. These correctness values are what is used to decide the color of the note
  when displayed on the VGA, where white is 0 meaning neither correct nor incorrect, green is correct, and red is
  incorrect. Also, when the correctness array is modified the total notes run as well as the total notes correct are
  updated, and then used to update the accuracy component displayed in the corner of the VGA.</p>
<br>
<p>Once the last note of the song leaves the VGA screen, or if the user hits a configured reset button that only works
  in the game state, the game will return back to the song selection state. With this, the entire logic of the game is
  complete.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="hardware-software-tradeoffs-">Hardware/software tradeoffs:</h2>
<p>One tradeoff we decided on was the sample rate of the FFT. A lower value allowed for a faster refresh rate giving
  more accuracy with respect to time, while more samples gave us a faster accuracy with respect to time. We decided to
  use the lowest sample rate that consistently detected the notes in our used range correctly, which was 512 samples per
  FFT and a sample rate of 10kHz. With it, we had sufficient accuracy for time as well since the user inputs felt
  acknowledged almost immediately so we left it on those parameters.</p>
<br>
<p>Another software aspect we tweaked with was when a detected fundamental frequency would be loud enough in amplitude
  to be used by the game. This tradeoff allowed involved the ability to raise the threshold which reduces noise but can
  also shut out actual notes. To Identify our desired threshold we set the microphone next to our computer speaker
  playing a digital piano at a reasonable volume. We started with a high threshold and lowered it until we ended with
  one that was able to catch the entirety of a piano note, finding that this threshold was suitably resistant to noise.
