	<br>To achieve the objective of designing a miniature portable gaming console while using the RP2040 as the brains, the following must be determined. A 2.2 inch TFT Display 240x320 pixels SPI LCD (ILI9341 driver) served as the display along with implementing 6 push buttons as user input to control. The initial buttons will involve controlling the game such as, identifying how to control speed, movement and direction. Next, the game will be tuned to encompass a sound that will generate from a small buzzer if the player loses the game. The graphics will then be added to show the score value of the game being played to keep track of the player’s points and if the player loses the game, “game over” will appear immediately. Then, the buttons will have specific commands to perform switching between games, exiting a game and returning to the main menu screen. The final structure of the console will have wires soldered beneath the circuit board to allow better mobility during gameplay.<br>
	<br>In week 1, we assembled the construction of the console and the ILI9341 display was interfaced with the pico using a micropython ILI9341 driver. The first game is pong, where the player will control a paddle at the bottom of the screen to ensure the ball is bouncing around the screen, but not the bottom. This is done through setting two push button inputs to add controls for the paddle to either move left or right on command. Sounds were also added for the game to have an immersive effect for the player and would occur when the ball would bounce off a wall, paddle or the floor. When the ball touches the floor a different sound compared to if it bounced off the wall or paddle would be generated, indicating an ending tone to signify the game is over. The score of the game was also added as a text shown on the upper right corner of the screen along with a “Game Over” text displayed at the center of the screen when the game is over. <br>
	<br>In week 2, the circuit and breadboard connections were cleaned up because ease of gameplay is important. The state of the breadboard with wires can interfere with the gameplay, making it difficult to press the buttons to control the game. Therefore, shorter wire segments replaced the jumper wires. The next game to focus on was similar to space invaders. Sprite drawings that represent small images in the game were animated through converting RAW color565 format and button inputs similar to the initial game of pong were implemented to successfully maneuver the image. <br>
	<br>In week 3, we configured a menu and navigation options to switch between the three games, and exit the game to return to the main menu of selecting what game the player would like to play. To enhance the gameplay a solder board was used to hide the wires an ensure they are connected permanently. <br>
