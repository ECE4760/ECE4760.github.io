<p>Please see the following video demonstration of our project:</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>The biggest blocker in speed is the FFT sample collection. One frame is created for every audio sample, forcing our
  screen to operate at about 10 fps. The number of samples is discussed in the Program Design section. This is adequate
  for the game because everything moves slowly enough that 10fps looks smooth. Additionally, the delay between playing
  the note and seeing it appear on screen is low enough that it isn&#39;t noticable by humans.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2>
<p>The program was largely accuate, and able to detect notes properly. It would infrequently mis-classify a note as
  being the same note but one octave higher, due to the harmonics in the cepstrum of our samples. This happened
  infrequently enough and for short enough periods of time that it rarely prevented the user from hitting a target when
  whey played a note.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<p>There aren&#39;t any safety concerns for this project. The hardware only includes a VGA connection and microphone
  circuit, which cannot cause any physical harm to the user.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="usability">Usability</h2>
<p>This is a usable project. The buttons provide an interactive interface, which allows the user to easily select a song
  and speed to play it. People who are more adept with music than the group members may take time to get used to our
  vertical bars to represent the notes, instead of sheet music, but that&#39;s the case for any graphical representation
  of music.</p>
<br>
<p>The biggest barrier to using this project is knowing having an instrument to play and knowing how to play it.</p><br>
