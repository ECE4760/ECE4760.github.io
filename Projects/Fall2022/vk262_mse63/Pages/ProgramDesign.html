<p>Our FFT code is based on the cricket FFTfix function applied with Prof. Land’s pseudocode into a cepstrum, from which
  the peak frequency is picked from a max amplitude check. Once we understood how to implement this from the provided
  guidance and some research online we were able to successfully make this part work.</p>
<br>
<p>The states leading up to the game were also easy to implement. For these, we just changed the display to show the
  choices of song or difficulty, and used the buttons to update which option was hovered in the state variable and save
  that choice when it was selected. The song copied a saved array of the song’s notes and timings into a temp variable
  for the game, and the difficulty selection would modify those timings to make the game faster or slower. From here,
  all that was left was the game itself.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the biggest challenges and also one we ran into towards the beginning of our code was how our notes would
  descend from the top of the screen and change from user input. We made it so there were 24 vertical channels on the
  screen, one for each of the 24 notes we used. This aspect used a function we made called coldrop which takes all of
  the pixels in a column and pulls them down by a desired offset. In these columns, all of the pixels were pulled down
  each timestep, with the speed of descent varying with difficulty. When the microphone picks up a note it will draw a
  cyan rectangle on the channel of the respective note, and that will be pulled down the channel so it’s accurate with
  respect to time. As stated earlier the color of the note boxes changes when correct/incorrect, which is done by
  overlaying the new color over the old one so the new color is pulled down the channel instead. Now our display was
  able to keep up with all of the active parts of the game without visual bugs.</p>
<br>
<p>With that complete applying input from the microphone involved taking the max pitch and converting in the way
  mentioned earlier. That value is checked by the game and displayed on screen. </p>

<p>We utilized the pseudocode from Bruce Land on how to write a cepstrum, which can be found on this page: <a

<p>Something we hoped to try but never got around to was detecting longer notes. We considered ways of modeling them as
  a continuous sequence of smaller notes, but in the end, we never put it into code. Since we only had access to a
  digital piano for instruments, we also thought it would be hard to detect the longer notes since piano notes last such
  a brief amount of time.</p>
<br>
<p>Another idea we had tried to flesh out but failed in was detecting chords or multiple notes at the same time. Our
  code worked by identifying the dominant note, which makes it hard to identify multiple notes at once as you need a
  consistent threshold that won’t let in noise. It’s also harder for the program to discern notes when more than one is
  active at the same time which was costing us too much accuracy in the end to go through with.</p><br>
