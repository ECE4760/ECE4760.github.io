<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<h2 id="design-analysis">Design Analysis</h2>
<p>The final design was largely in line with expectations. When the members first proposed the project, they were
  unaware of pitch detection, and only later learned of the use of the cepstrum to calculate it. There aren&#39;t any
  legal standards that this design must conform to, so it isn&#39;t in violation of anything</p>
<br>
<p>If there were future development, notes of longer length which require a sustained output would be an interesting
  feature to add. Additionally, a penalty could be added for playing notes which aren&#39;t meant to be played. This
  would be beneficial to the gameplay experience, as someone can currently &quot;pass&quot; the game by playing many
  notes at once. Chord detection would be difficult to add but perhaps possible given enough time and research.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="intellectual-property-considerations">Intellectual Property Considerations</h2>
<p>The only code not written by the members of the group are the FFT and VGA library examples provided by V. Hunter
  Adams. All other code is original. No proprietary parts or software were used in this project.</p>
<br>
<p>All songs included in the project are in the public domain.</p>
<br>
<p>There likely aren&#39;t patent opportunities for this project.</p><br>
