      <h3 class="w3-justify">Logical Structure</h3>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        At a high-level, our project structure is shown in the following block
        diagram. There are 3 different types of inputs: Physical key presses,
        song button presses, and instrument button presses. Each of these modify
        either the notes to be played (stored in the notes buffer), or the
        parameters used in FM synthesis. The FM Synthesis generates a final
        output wave that is sent to the speakers through the DAC.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/logic.png" />

      <h2 class="w3-wide">Basic Sound Synthesis</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        In our project, digitally producing the instrument sounds is based on
        Frequency Modulation Synthesis to compute amplitude values for a note at
        a particular frequency, using additive synthesis to combine notes at
        different frequencies into a single output waveform.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">FM Sound Synthesis</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis is a more complicated method of
        sound synthesis which involves modulating a waveform using another
        waveform. Two waveforms are generated, and one is used to modulate the
        other. Each of the waveforms is controlled by a logic structure which
        sets them differently based on how long the note has been played, and
        the relevant attack,sustain, and decay parameters.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        At each time step the modulating waveform is calculated first, and then
        it’s amplitude is used to determine how far to step the main waveform
        along a precalculated sine table. This causes the mainwave to progress
        through the sinetable at different speeds based on the value of the
        modulating waveform. This modulated frequency can better simulate many
        instruments when compared to the single pitch that the basic synthesis
        algorithm generates.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">Playing Multiple Notes</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        To make playing multiple notes simultaneously possible, and to avoid
        needing to constantly recalculate certain values we initialize a variety
        of arrays to handle all of the possible notes. Each pitch that can be
        played is represented by a singular index. This makes it easy to save
        the appropriate parameters for each note’s wave form between
        calculations, and also means that we synthesize multiple output signals.
        We use additive synthesis to combine these signals into one output
        signal to send to the DAC. To improve efficiency we also included a
        buffer array which holds the indexes of the currently active notes. This
        allows us to skip iterating over notes which are not currently being
        played.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">Additive Sound Synthesis</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        For playing notes at the same time, we used the principle of additive
        synthesis to add together all of the amplitude values to create a sound
        comprising all the frequencies (for example, for playing a chord). This
        is simple, and only requires that at each time step we sum the
        amplitudes of every note that is playing. We then divide by the number
        of notes playing to normalize the volume. Without normalizing the output
        signal could spike in volume when notes are pressed or released.
        Additionally the DAC expects a signal within a specific range, so
        exceeding this range can lead to undesired behavior. This normalized
        accumulated wave was used as the final output to the DAC.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">MIDI File Processing</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        A Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) file is a widely accepted
        format to store music. Unlike an mp3 or wav file it does not contain
        real audio data, but instead the notes played, their timing, duration,
        and desired loudness, in sequence. Since it does not store audio data,
        it is much smaller in size than eg. an alternative mp3 file, making it
        ideal for our purpose with limited data storage.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        It is also easily compatible with different instruments, simply by
        playing the frequency corresponding to the note on the particular
        instrument. Further, this allows easy changes in temp based on the
        user’s preference.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        Each MIDI note number is mapped to a particular frequency, corresponding
        to a note. For example, MIDI note number 60 corresponds to middle C on
        the piano (C4). We used the following formula to map MIDI note numbers
        to a frequency used for FM synthesis: f = 440 * 2^((n - 69) / 12)
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">Capacative Touch Sensors</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        We initially planned to use capacitive touch sensing so that simply
        touching the keys would register as a key press. Capacitive touch
        sensing utilizes an RC circuit to detect when a contact is touched. By
        placing a resistor in line with a plate of metal that acts as a
        capacitor an RC circuit is created. If it is connected to a GPIO pin it
        can be powered to charge the circuit. The pin can then be set as an
        input so that it can read the voltage as it decays. Since the rate of
        decay is related to the value of the capacitor and the resistance is
        known, the capacitance can be calculated. When the plate of metal is
        touched the capacitance changes, which changes the decay rate, which can
        be detected by the controller.
      </p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">Human Conductance Sensing</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        During implementation we encountered issues. The RP2040’s analog input
        could not reliably register touch, and each reading required multiple
        analog reads and precise time keeping. In response to this, we pivoted
        our plan and used human conductance to allow a similar effect. We placed
        a 1 mega ohm pullup resistor on the input. Then, when a human touches
        the contact while grounding themselves they close the circuit with their
        body pulling the sensor reading low.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        The low power involved insures safety in normal use cases. According to
        <a
          href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/fy07_sh-16610-07_01_pg-module_1.pdf"
          >OSHA</a
        >
        the resistance of a human body ranges in the magnitude of 100,000 ohms
        while the skin is dry and unbroken. The RP2040 runs on 3.3 volt logic,
        although the power source can be 5v if supplied through the micro usb
        port. Even if there were a massive short and the 5v supply were routed
        through the human conductor the current would remain significantly below
        1 ma, which is the point at which humans start to notice the
        electricity. Currents of up to 5 ma do not immediately cause injuries,
        which gives us a large factor of safety. However, out of an abundance of
        caution we recommend that individuals who may be at increased risk from
        electrical sources refrain from using the RPiano.
      </p>
      <h2 class="w3-wide">Multiplexers</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        Since the RP2040 only has 28 GPIO pins, we needed to multiplex the
        inputs from the keyboard in order to have all of the functionality we
        wanted. We chose to use two 16x1 analog multiplexers (cd74hc4067). The
        multiplexers required 4 GPIO pins to select which of the 16 inputs
        should be passed through to the common output. We were able to reuse the
        same selector signal for both of the muxes. This meant that they always
        selected the same chanel as each other, but since we read the input with
        separate analog input pins this simply meant that we made two analog
        reads at each selector signal configuration.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        This system enabled us to utilize 29 analog inputs while using only four
        selector pins and two input pins, which freed up the other pins on the
        RP2040 to handle the other button inputs, and the speaker output. With
        additional multiplexers we could have expanded the sensing capabilities
        to 64 keys with only 2 additional analog input pins.
      </p>
      <h2 class="w3-wide">DAC</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        We used a MCP4802 digital to analog converter (DAC) to send our output
        signal from the RP2040 to a set of speakers. The DAC uses the Serial
        Peripheral Interface (SPI) to take digital input from the RP2040 and
        convert it to analog signal. This allows us to control a speaker from
        the RP2040.
