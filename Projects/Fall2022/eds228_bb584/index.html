                    <p>
                        We used a Pico W to host a webserver with hardware peripherals at home which would allow
                        housemates to receive or send alerts to each other from their mobile devices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our goal was first to use the Pico W to connect to the internet and host a webserver we could
                        connect from our personal devices. We added layers of complexity as we went, based on what we
                        were interested in implementing and what would be a positive addition to the Alert Center. We
                        first wanted to use the webpage to control an output device, so we implemented a TFT display on
                        which we could display messages entered through the webpage. We then wanted to try communicating
                        from pico to personal device, so we added a sound sensor and displayed a red square on the
                        webpage when a loud sound was detected. We also added two switches (one for each housemate) that
                        each housemate would toggle to indicate whether or not they are home, this state would also be
                        displayed on the webpage. Our last task was implementing audio. We used DDS to synthesize sounds
                        that could be selected from the remote webpage and played at home.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Design</h1> <br>
                    <h4>High Level</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our project can be broken down into 4 major components. The hardware peripherals, the
                        micropython code, the C modules, and the webpage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The part of the Alert Center that remains at home consisted of all the hardware. The Pico W and
                        the peripherals were soldered onto a protoboard. A TFT display was used to display messages sent
                        from the webpage. We had a switch assigned to each housemate to represent their state (switch 1
                        in position 1: housemate 1 is home, switch 1 in position 2: housemate 1 is not home) which was
                        displayed on the webpage. A sound sensor was used to detect if there was a fire alarm or other
                        loud noise. Finally, a DAC, audio socket, and speaker were used to play audio.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We used micropython to host the webpage as the documentation for it was much better compared to
                        the documentation for C. This choice made the internet connectivity aspect of our project much
                        simpler as we had a good guide to follow. The Thonny IDE was used as our development environment
                        to run the micropython code, open a serial connection, and store files on the Pico W. The TFT
                        display library, the html page, TFT font files, and the <em>main.py</em> python program were
                        stored locally on the Pico W. The <em>main.py</em> python file contained the logic for
                        connecting to the internet, launching the webpage, and handling the events triggered by the
                        hardware peripherals or the webpage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The html webpage served as the remote user interface for the system. We styled it using CSS and
                        included some JS elements for functionality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        C code was used to perform direct digital synthesis (DDS) since micropython cannot complete the
                        computations and write to the DAC quickly enough. We also already had most of the code written
                        for this from lab 1, so we had some boiler plate already. We experienced great difficulty with
                        calling native C functions from micropython, but eventually we established communication between
                        the C and micropython code bases.
                    </p>



                    <h4>Hardware</h4>
                    <p>
                        The hardware of the project includes a Raspberry Pi Pico W, ILI9340 TFT Display, 2 on-on toggle
                        switches, KY-037 sound sensor, MCP4822 DAC, and an audio socket mounted onto a protoboard.
                        Speakers are connected to the audio socket.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our project started off on a breadboard, once we tested each individual component's
                        functionality, we soldered them onto a protoboard. This made the system more sturdy and serve
                        its purpose of being a Home Alert Center as it could be safely mounted somewhere in the house.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Pico W was chosen for our microcontroller board as it included the Infineon CYW43439 chip
                        providing it with WiFi connectivity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The TFT Display communicated with the Pico W via SPI. We referenced the Adafruit webpage about
                        this display to understand pin functions. The VBUS pin from the Pico W was used to provide the
                        display with 5V.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The center pin of each toggle switch was connected to a GPIO pin on the Pico W. Each of the
                        other two pins were tied to ground and 3V3. So when the switch was flipped one way, the input to
                        the Pico W was high, and low the other way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The sound sensor was connected to a Pico W GPIO pin. The mic was also removed from the module
                        and placed in a more practical location on the protoboard. The module had a potentiometer which
                        allowed us to tune its sensitivity. If there was a noise louder than the set threshold, the
                        input to a particular GPIO pin on the Pico W was high.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A 12-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) was used to convert the digital signals synthesized
                        using DDS to analog signals. The DAC communicates with the Pico W over SPI. The outputs of the
                        DAC are sent to an audio socket which is connected to a speaker to output audio.
                    </p>






                    <h4>Micropython Software</h4>
                    <p>
                        During power up, the micropython firmware installed on the Pico W runs the main.py file
                        automatically. The python file connects the Pico W to WiFi and deploys the webpage. It also
                        handles subsequent events triggered by the hardware peripherals or the webpage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In main.py, we first initialized the TFT object, pins, and variables, and we read the html file
                        to a string variable. We then connected to an available WiFi network, heavily using the code
                        from the Pico W datasheet. The Pico W has an inbuilt network library that was utilized.
                        Functions from the library were used to assign the network, ensure that it is active, connect to
                        it using the given name and password, and then wait for a fixed timeout duration to connect. If
                        the connection was not successful, we would run the code again. We could not completely figure
                        out why the Pico W sometimes had difficulty connecting but we did notice that it happened far
                        less frequently on faster WiFi networks. If the connection was successful, we could access the
                        Pico W assigned local IP address (192.168.1.X).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We used an open source library for the TFT display. We changed the number of bytes written in
                        each SPI write so that the graphics would display faster. Given the limited storage space that
                        the Pico W has, we also cut down the library and kept only the functions we were using.
                        Additionally, there were a few bugs in the library that we fixed. If a word was too long to be
                        displayed on the screen, it would initially get cut off. We updated this error so that the word
                        will get split up and displayed on different lines. We noticed that when we reset the cursor to
                        the origin, the origin was not always in the same location and was rather based on the previous
                        command. We began to fix this but realized that it is only a problem if there is more text than
                        can fit on the screen, since we want ours to function as a message board, all the text should be
                        seen so we put a cap on the length of text entered in the webpage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The socket library (also distributed with micropython) was used to create web sockets. We wrote logic in micropython to listen for HTTP connection requests on the local IP address and port 80. Under the hood, web browsers send servers HTTP GET requests when interacting with webpages. The html directs the browser to different URL’s so that the Pico W receives an HTTP request when the page is first opened, refreshed, or one of the buttons is pressed. By parsing the origin field of the HTTP header, the Pico W responds with the corresponding event handler. 
                        </p>
                        

                    <p>
                        The webpage has three buttons: submit, audio, check in. Submit is used to send a text message to
                        the TFT display, audio is used to play audio, and the check in button is used to see who's home
                        and the state of the alarm. Each of these buttons were a link to 192.168.1.X/?”button name”. So
                        the url of the page would change accordingly. So in the get request, we could search to see if
                        “button name” was present and we would know whether the button was pressed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the submit button was pressed, there was also some javascript in the html file that set the
                        url to include the text that was entered in the textbox. Some string processing and ASCII
                        decoding was done to the GET request to get a clean copy of the text which was then displayed on
                        the TFT.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the check in button was pressed, the value of the two housemate switches and sound sensor
                        were read. If the sensor pin was high, we display text “Alarm on” and a red square on the
                        webpage, and ”Alarm off” with a green square otherwise. This is done by using .replace() on the
                        html string. For example, html.replace("Alarm Off","Alarm On"). Next, if the switch states have
                        changed, the color that each name is displayed in is changed, green if home, red if not. This
                        update was also done using the string replace function. This part of the project was not ideal
                        as we wanted the webpage to update live without the need for any action from the user, however,
                        we are only able to send anything to the server after we receive something as HTTP is
                        unidirectional communication. Only once a request is received, a response is sent. We did not
                        realize this when we began trying to implement the feature so we tried many different options.
                        Our most significant idea was to use interrupts, we checked for a change in level of the
                        switches and updated the html file in the ISR. When we tested this solution we realized that the
                        html file was getting updated immediately but it still was not getting displayed until there was
                        a user request from the webpage. We assumed that the code was just running in a continuous loop
                        but we added print statements throughout the file and noticed that it was stalling right after
                        the call to receive an HTTP request. We tried making that call timeout so that we could move
                        forward but that did not work either. At this point we did more research to understand HTTP and
                        realized how HTTP functions. We then tried to alter the page so that it automatically sent a
                        request every few seconds to give the illusion of live updates, but given the very slow WiFi
                        speeds we were experiencing, we realized that this was not an elegant or sustainable solution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the audio button was pressed, we made a call to examplemodule.c to run DDS and write to the
                        DAC.
                    </p>

                        We synthesized an alarm noise which acts as a bell in the alert system. To synthesize our audio,
                        we used DDS. The DDS class webpage and example code were heavily used. We modified the provided
                        DDS code to output tones at 1400 Hz. A 1000 cycle beep was played 680 cycles apart 5 times, and
                        then repeated after a 15000 cycle pause. This was done by setting the DDS phase incrementer to
                        (1400 * 2<sup>32</sup>)/40000. 2<sup>32</sup> was used as 32 bits were used to represent the
                        phasor angle. The DDS algorithm would first enter the interrupt service routine (ISR), increment
                        the phasor angle by the incrementer, use the sine lookup table to send the amplitude at that
                        angle to the DAC every 1/40000 s. A finite state machine was set up to determine whether a beep
                        or a pause should be playing and for how long. We cut the audio off after 5 seconds.

                    <h4>Calling C from micropython</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are two general approaches to calling C code from the micropython layer of a rp2 board.
                        The static approach is to compile and link micropython with an external C module, and flash it
                        to the board. The dynamic link approach is to register your module interface with the
                        micropython interpreter (this involves building and flashing the interpreter once) and importing
                        a native .mpy file from the micropython file directory that matches the registered interface.
                        The dynamic link approach means you don’t have to recompile the entire interpreter everytime you
                        want to edit your external C file. More information can be found here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We spent 20+ hours on both approaches and were able to get the static approach working and
                        almost got the dynamic approach to work. We will write more detailed instructions in the hope
                        that it may help a poor soul in the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We cloned the micropython repo, and found a useful <em>examplemodule.c</em> in
                        <em>micropython/examples/usercmodule/cexample</em>. The <em>examplemodule.c</em> file
                        distributed with the micropython repo has an example showing how to wrap C primitives into
                        python objects and the macros to register your C function with the python namespace. The default
                        build automation seems to compile and link the <em>examplemodule.c</em> when building the
                        interpreter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The example_module_globals_table defines the module interface. You must register anything you
                        wish to be accessible from micropython here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Include statements like <em>/#include "pico/stdlib.h"</em> should just work because the
                        micropython repo includes a <em>pico-sdk</em> folder.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Congrats! Your custom module can be imported through the micropython interface with <em> import
                            cexample</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>We were able to compile and link the micropython interpreter itself with the DDS code. There is
                        also a dynamic link approach where a C file can be compiled to a .mpy file and put into the
                        python file system. We now have an updated html string that we need to display so it is sent
                        using the opened socket and then the socket is closed. Compile to a native machine code file and
                        let the python interpreter dynamically include it
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our project was successfully able to develop an IoT node and facilitate two-way communication
                        between the hardware peripherals and webpage. The performance of the system was highly dependent
                        on the WiFi network we were using. When using home WiFi, which is fast and stable, the updates
                        on both sides (page and peripherals) were essentially instantaneous. When using a slow hotspot
                        (which we had to do on campus because we were not able to connect to campus networks) the system
                        was extremely slow and updates would take several seconds to appear. This, however, meant that
                        the issue was not with our design. The only place we saw a slight drop in speed was when writing
                        to the TFT display. Since we are using micropython, it is visibly slow. We embraced this speed
                        and displayed just one word at a time making it seem like the slow speed was a stylistic choice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We realized when we were testing our final product that the sound sensor was not very reliable
                        and after a few seconds it would build a tolerance to the sound level and not detect sound at
                        the same volume anymore. We had to constantly change the sensitivity level of the potentiometer.
                        This makes this part of the system essentially unusable but it can be easily rectified using a
                        higher quality sensor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project in its current state is not very practical as both users (home and remote) have to
                        be connected to the same WiFi network, which means the system can only be used at home. We do
                        know that it is possible to host users on other networks and make this project more practical.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>
                        The results of our project mostly met our expectations and we were happy with our final product.
                        Our initial goal was to connect to the web with the Pico W and then see how much complexity we
                        could add on. We wanted to implement two way communication (Pico W to web, web to Pico W), and
                        add as many peripherals as needed to make it a well-equipped Alert Center. We wanted to run
                        logic written in both C and micropython to enable further extensibility. We were successful in
                        completing all of these goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The one task we were not able to complete was being able to connect to the Pico W from anywhere
                        in the world. Currently, we can only access the webpage if we are on the same LAN as the Pico W.
                        We are not too upset about this, however, since the work involved more troubleshooting than
                        engineering. We spent some time registering the Pico W MAC address with Cornell IT, but the
                        RedRover network would fail to allocate an IP address to the Pico W. It is something that we
                        hope to implement in the future as it will allow us to actually use it as a Home Alert Center.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If we could do anything differently we would have had a clearer goal to start off with and done
                        more research. Since we were adding complexity as we went along, we encountered obstacles that
                        could have been avoided if we had planned ahead. For example, had we known that we wanted to
                        have live updates on the webpage, we could have used something other than HTTP requests.

                        We used an open source library for the TFT display which we slightly modified to better suit our
                        needs. We used the code on the Pico W datasheet as a starting point to host the webpage. Our
                        code from lab 1 was used for audio synthesis which included example code from class.
