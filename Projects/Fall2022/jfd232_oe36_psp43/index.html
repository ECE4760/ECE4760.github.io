                <p style="margin:2%">
                <p>For our final project, we built a Snake-inspired game run through the RP2040 and connected to a VGA
                    display.
                    The game has a hard mode and stores user high scores for a play session.</p>

                <p>Our version of the Snake Game closely follows classical versions in which the player starts off with
                    a snake that can move around on a grid using button controls, and eating an apple will grow the
                    snake's lengths, but crashing into the rest of the snake body or board’s walls will end the game. We
                    designed our iteration to include a hard mode and stores the user’s high scores during the play
                    session. Leading up to the final project, we knew we wanted to develop a type of arcade game, since
                    they tend to be a great way to both test and develop ones’ skills when learning a new language or
                    technology. Games development requires us to focus and learn about several different categories of
                    development and engineering. Just on the software side, we not only had to think about the software
                    and data structures underlying the game, but also, had to think about optimization as well as game
                    logic. Hardware of course was important, we had to assess the best way to display information to the
                    user, and take in information from the user. We also had to think about more subjective things like
                    how “fun” a game is, or how the game should feel. We had to make considerations of game design and
                    making a product that isn’t just technically sound, but also engaging for users. We picked Snake
                    specifically since it is a game that has a lot of different metrics for success, as well as tangible
                    checkpoints for our development. There were always more quality of life features and inspirations to
                    add, but also good points to aim towards or stop at if development went better or worse than
                    expected.

                <h2>High Level Design</h2>
                <p> As we said earlier, we thought it would be interesting and pedagogically effective to work on a game
                    for our final project. We elected to do Snake for a variety of reasons, but mostly due to the
                    capacity for interesting software opportunities and a good affinity the game had with the medium it
                    would be played on. We knew we were going to be using the VGA display and that the button array we
                    would use would have to be relatively simple since there are only a limited number of GPIO pins on
                    the Raspberry Pi Pico. The VGA pushed us toward more retro style games since they would look most
                    fitting on an older, less advanced display. The button array didn’t actually limit us too much once
                    we agreed to a retro game, but Snake was a good game we had all played that used only 4 buttons,
                    which was perfect for our design. Another reason we picked Snake was that there was a lot of
                    capacity for different game modes and things to add that could improve the game and provide more
                    things to keep trying to add and work on.
                </p>

                <p>There weren't many advanced calculations to do actually for the purposes of this project. One thing
                    somewhat math related we had to implement was collision detection. We wanted to make it as efficient
                    as possible since collision detection is often a big performance sink in modern video games. To
                    combat this, we elected to use a simple grid system to hold and set the position of each wall, snake
                    segment, apple, and block element in the game. The grid system would be used when handling any of
                    the game logic and would allow the game to be easily configured to be smaller, larger, or have more
                    maneuverability. Once it came to displaying the items, we would extrapolate the grid position into a
                    position on the actual display based on the size of the game area we decided on. This meant that any
                    collision would just be a comparison of two position variables of type short per item. It also
                    helped that by the mechanics of the game, any place a segment of the snake goes, the head of the
                    snake had to go first. Using this, we would only ever have to detect collisions for the head, rather
                    than the rest of the body, and save quite a bit of performance.

                </p>

                <p> The code behind the game makes a lot of use of C structs to track the positions of and perform the
                    interactions between the different objects in the game. Each segment of the snake was an instance of
                    a struct of type snake_t, the apple an instance of type apple_t, and the blocks for hard mode an
                    instance of type block_t. Snake_t instances are quite similar to nodes in a linked list in that they
                    link to the two snake_t instances that touch the snake segment on either end. Aside from this, they
                    hold the direction the specific segment is heading and the position of the segment. This node-like
                    structure allowed for some very intuitive code when it came to having the snake move in a direction
                    or detecting collision that the snake had with itself. To implement game logic, we started with a
                    recursive function that would go through the links in the nodes in reverse order, so we would start
                    at the tail node and compare fields accordingly to make it take on the same fields as its preceding
                    node.
                </p>

                <h5>Hard Mode Gameplay</h5>
                &nbsp;  

                <div class="section-div" id="hld">
                    <h2>Logical Structure</h5>
                        <p> Our program utilized a single PT thread on the Pico, that takes care of all GPIO user inputs
                            and game logic. We believed that a secondary user input thread was not necessary because the
                            frequency of button presses would not be substantial enough to delay the rest of our
                            program, thus we found it easier to incorporate button presses with the rest of the logic
                            and not have to rely on interrupts when a button, we would instead simply change the heading
                            direction of the snake and also be able to more easily use button presses to initialize or
                            reset the game. Our display logic, including the game board and game score also all runs on
                            the same thread, only updating the pixels when a function is called or during every frame,
                            rather than updating every cycle, in order to reduce flickering and improve smoothness. Most
                            of our code’s complexity comes from our game logic and implementation of rule sets, in which
                            the sequential order of functions and monitoring the snake head’s location is imperative.
                        </p>
                        <img src="src/assets/flowchart.png" alt="">
                        <h5>Game Logic</h5>
                        &nbsp;  
                </div>

                <p>As we were wrapping up the main functionality of our Snake game, we also wanted to add extra features
                    to improve the user experience, such as maintaining a high score, increasing the snake’s speed over
                    time, adding a Hard mode, and finally adding sound effects to in-game events and possibly having a
                    brief death animation for the snake.
                </p>
                <p>To implement the Hard mode, we decided to change two major things: remove the grid visuals and make
                    the board a solid color to make it trickier to navigate and spawn walls in the middle of the board
                    that would kill the snake if it collided. The main challenge of Hard mode was spawning the wall
                    elements, giving them random locations (instead of selected predetermined ones in an array) and
                    clearing them properly to prevent the snake from dying to “ghost” obstacles. As mentioned in our
                    high-level description, we treated these wall objects as a mix between our snake and apple
                    implementation, in which we allocated an array of size 40 in memory for the expected max number of
                    obstacles a typical player may reach, and added walls to the array as tails in the linked list, just
                    like the snake. However, we also had to spawn these wall objects just like we spawned apples, so we
                    had to generate random positions on the grid for them and spawn them every 2 apples. Then we
                    utilized the same strategy as our snake body collision detection to iterate through the list of wall
                    objects and see if the snake head ever collided with them. A tricky part of initializing the
                    different wall/barrier elements was making sure that once we reset the game and ran through the PT
                    thread again, the old walls would no longer be on the board and would not interfere with the snake’s
                    hitbox. This was an important step and was handled similarly to how we reset the snake’s length at
                    the beginning of every round since the walls also had their own pre-allocated array. In order to
                    accomplish resetting, while the snake is being initialized, we would also always set the first
                    element in the block array as the head and tail of the linked list, and then set its position to be
                    outside of the game board to ensure it would never accidentally collide with the snake, then we
                    would also keep an unmodified pointer to the original head of the wall array so that we would detach
                    the rest of the wall nodes in the old array in case the game resets.
                </p>

                <p>One of the software issues that did come with this however, was that the memory for each node had to
                    be preallocated. If we tried to create a new node for each segment of the snake once an apple was
                    eaten, the nodes would get deallocated and would cease to exist for more than a frame. We also
                    didn’t want to go through and allocated each 400 possible segments individually, so what we ended up
                    doing was allocating an array of 400 snake segments before the main game loop. These segments would
                    all have NULL values and not be linked. We would store an index for the array, and once an apple was
                    eaten, link the segment we are up to to the rest of the snake and set it as the new tail. This meant
                    that when it came to memory, the snake was an array and when it came to actual game logic, the snake
                    was a linked list. Unfortunately, this did mean we used much more memory than would realistically be
                    used in a game, but we wanted to be safe when setting the upper limit for snake segments.
                </p>

                <p>In terms of software tradeoffs, we did have to stick with 3-bit color for the VGA. We wanted to
                    integrate more colors into the game, but unfortunately were unable to due to time and performance
                    constraints. One of the benefits, however, of sticking with just the 8 colors we did have, was that
                    it allowed us to replicate the feel of old games quite well, which did make the game feel more retro
                    and closer to our inspiration. Additionally, if time permitted, we considered implementing a change
                    within the fillRect() function provided to us in String.h so that we could utilize memcpy() in order
                    to draw rectangles faster on the screen and optimize our graphics.

                </p>
                <p>Fortunately, since we weren’t capitalizing from the game or monetizing at all, we didn’t really have
                    to deal with
                    any copyright or trademark issues.

                <h2>Program/Hardware Design</h2>
                <h4>Hardware:</h4>
                <p>For our hardware, we did not have any complicated connections or pin layouts, and we were able to
                    reuse most of the hardware we had implemented from previous labs, as well as four push buttons for
                    the actual gameplay. Originally our hardware design included the use of large colorful arcade-style
                    buttons or potentially using a joystick to move the snake, however these materials did not arrive in
                    time for our project.</p>
                <img src="src/assets/Circuitboard.jpg" alt="" width="360">
                <h5>Snake Game Circuit Board</h5>
                &nbsp;  
                
                <p>Our VGA display connection is operated with three inputs: HSYNC, VSYNC, red, green, blue. We used
                    GPIO pins 18, 19, and 20 connected each with a 330 ohm resistor to the proper color ports for the
                    RGB components of the VGA, shown in Figure 1. Pin 16 was used as the HSYNC, which tells the display
                    when to move to a new row of pixels. Pin 17 was used for VSYNC, which tells the display when to
                    start a new frame. The wiring of this can be seen in Figure 1. Additionally regarding the VGA, we
                    utilized three PIO blocks on the RP2040, using the separated state machine and processing
                    capabilities to drive high bandwidth communication and high speed digital interface to the VGA
                    without costing CPU computation cycles. The PIO works by executing sequential Assembly programs and
                    instructions, with the ability to manipulate GPIOs and transfer data by communicating with
                    interrupts and FIFO’s using its 32-bit shift registers. PIO has 9 different Assembly instructions,
                    and the advantage of the state machine is that it is guaranteed to fetch and execute each
                    instruction in one cycle. These capabilities ultimately allow us to use 3 separate PIO programs to
                    generate the two timing signals, HSYNC and VSYNC, as well as the combined RGB signals so that we
                    could offload the work needed to display images on the screen from the Pico’s CPU and save clock
                    cycles and thus allow us to simulate more snake elements if necessary.

                </p>
                <p>The four buttons were simple GPIO inputs, with two possible states: high or low. We used GPIO pins 8,
                    9, 10, and 11 to connect these buttons on the board with the Pico. As with most buttons, these ones
                    just had their first notch connected through a 5K resistor to ground, and the second notch connected
                    to the voltage. We tried our best to keep them in their relative directions to one another, but
                    ideally we would have had nicer arcade buttons to make our user interface better.

                <h4>Program:</h4>

                <p>In order to implement our program and logic structure, detailed earlier, we designed several functions to perform specific tasks or control and meet conditions that were met, such as moving the snake or colliding with objects. When we first created the snake struct and tried to create a linked list of these snake nodes, we didn’t realize that adding a tail to this linked list wasn’t as simple as just adding a new node; we were allocating space in memory. Due to this, our game kept crashing pretty immediately. We thought about fixing the issue by using malloc and free whenever we added or removed a tail, but ultimately decided that having a fixed amount of nodes allocated in the array at the beginning of the file would work best. Doing this allowed us to avoid the complications of dynamically allocating space, and whenever we needed to add onto our snake, we just referenced the next available index in this array.

                </p>
            <p>
                One of the core functions we implemented was addTail(), which once we fixed the allocation issue, was quite simple. We just had to return a pointer to an already allocated piece of memory. Then, we had to switch the pointer from pointing to the old tail to the new tail. Aside from that, we copied over values of position and direction for the old tail to the new tail so it would appear in the correct position and head in the correct direction and follow the old tail. Our next task was coding recursiveFollow(), which was tricky because we had to do extensive testing to understand if iterating through the list normally or reversely would be most effective. In order to consistently display the correct snake movement behavior, we decided to perform a reverse recursive parse through our linked list, so that the current node would take on all the characteristics and fields of its predecessor every frame to smoothly animate the snake’s movement.

            <p>For drawing the snake and apple, we had drawSnake and drawApple function, two different functions because we had to design the apple and snake as two different structs. These functions took in a bool called “erase” that would determine whether or not the snake or apple was being drawn or erased. For drawing the snake, it was called after the x and y positions were updated, and it would draw a green head at the new x and y coordinates. If the erase was true, then the tail of the snake was to be drawn over. It would either be drawn over in light blue or dark blue, or just dark blue if the game was in hard mode. Determining whether or not a square was a light blue or dark blue square was a matter of calculating whether or not the x and y values were even or odd squares on the grid.
                </p>
                <p>The drawApple function worked similar to the drawSnake function, but it was called once at the start of the game to draw an apple (“erase” set to false), or whenever an apple was eaten and needed to be redrawn at a new randomized position.
                </p>
                  
            <p>Another important feature in our game was our game_start and game_over boolean values. Both are initialized to false, and our program enters the main thread. Within the main thread, one of the first functions called is GameStart(), which prevents any logic from running so long as game_start is false. Within GameStart(), the game_start bool is only set to true when a button is pressed, and it is specifically set to hard mode when the up button is pressed. Pressing any button within this function also causes the game_over bool to be set to false.
            </p>
            <p>The game_over bool is also very important to resetting our game properly. There are only two scenarios where game_over is set to true: when the snake collides with itself or a wall. Once game_over is set to false, there is a condition at the end of our thread that will set game_start back to false, and therefore causes the game to get caught in the GameStart() function again in the next cycle.

                <p>The final task we set out to complete for this project was to implement sound effects into the game,
                    including a chomp sound when an apple was eaten and an end-game tune once you crashed. Due to time
                    constraints we were unable to complete all the necessary components of the sound generation to run,
                    however, we made significant progress in both the hardware and software implementation. Briefly, we
                    connected a MCP4822 Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to the Pico’s GPIO ports, with a max data rate
                    of 20 MHz, to convert digital sound bytes into analog audio signals. These DAC analog signals were
                    outputted through the DAC’s VOUTA and VOUTB pins were communicated via an SPI channel to the RP2040,
                    in which we set up dual-channel speakers to output the sound. In order to implement the software
                    portion, we followed most of the same strategy we used in Lab 1 for cricket chirps, and designed a
                    timer ISR on that would be constantly entered every cycle, but would only play sound if our
                    CHOMP_STATE flag was set when an apple was eaten. This would trigger our DAC which would send the
                    audio-bytes to the SPI to the speakers every clock cycle until the array of audio-bytes was
                    finished, then clear CHOMP_STATE. We planned to have an identical approach for triggering the
                    end-game sound effect, but we were unable to successfully get the chomp sound to output to the
                    speakers. In order to get the audio-byte arrays, we used MATLAB to read and convert the .mp3 files
                    into audio arrays that could be sent to the DAC. Then we saved each of the audio arrays in an
                    Audio.h header file, and defined the size of the arrays as well as rescaled the audio level values
                    to a max of 4095 to be correctly processed by the DAC. A potential issue with our implementation
                    that prevented us from achieving sound output was that if the SPI channel was being triggered every
                    clock cycle, it's possible the audio frequencies were too short to be heard, thus requiring a small
                    tweak to our software in the future.

            <div class="section-div" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> The two main results we have to focus on are the performance and the usability. Since we are making
                    a game that deals mostly with human interactions with buttons, there wasn’t much safety or high
                    accuracy to worry about. We also didn’t really have to deal with data for testing or scopes and
                    waveforms. The speed or performance was luckily not an issue for us. Since snake is a fairly light
                    game, and we were careful to make our collision and positioning of elements quite simple, we usually
                    had a lot of performance left on the table. In fact, we would increase the speed of the game and
                    retain the same frame rate if a player started getting a lot of points. In terms of usability, we
                    had some simple buttons that we used for user input. We had planned on having some much nicer and
                    better looking buttons to make the game feel better to play, but unfortunately, they did not come
                    in.</p>
                <p>Getting the snake tail to be properly added to the end of the snake and the subsequently following the snake head and erasing properly was an issue we had to tackle, but we were able to so by altering our C structs. Additionally, our whole reset functionality for the game was one of the more time consuming tasks, having to clear the whole board and respawning the snake in either a random position or always spawning in the same starting location, and then detaching the old tails from the new, respawned snake. Getting the snake to perfectly respawn with the original body length of 3 was very tricky. Some of our attempted solutions resulted in a single head being respawned but as it moved, the previous location would not be erased, so it became an infinitly long snake. Other solutions resulted in us not being able to reset the snake perfeclty, and instead you would keep the same length as your previous life, which wasn't great, but at least it was drawing visually to the screen correctly and setting the snake and all if its existing tales to correct location. Eventually, we came upon the final solution which was simple a one-liner that set the snake tail back to the snake head, effectively cutting our length down to 1 and delinking the rest of the snake elements, then adding two tails at the very beginning to get back to a length of 3. This process was tedious, but definitely very helpful in debugging and brainstorming new solutions that may or may not work. </p>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>The results mostly met our expectations, but we had some extra features we were really hoping to
                    implement that we did not get to implement. For one, we really wanted to integrate sound and more
                    colors into the game. We lost a lot of time trying to fix pointer issues we had with allocating the
                    nodes of the snake and so unfortunately, did not get to finish implementing those features. Next
                    time, we would definitely be more careful and be wary of the bugs that arise with not preallocating
                    memory. The only code we really reused was the code from the prior projects that we worked on and so
                    not much IP concerns. We didn’t have to deal with any non-disclosure agreements either. We were
                    reverse-engineering a pre-existing game for the project, but we didn’t worry too much about the
                    specifics of classic snake, and decided to use it as an inspiration rather than a strict guide.</p>
                <p>In the future, we would like to do the final steps to implement sound effects as well as adding new, intriguing game modes to keep the player engaged. We also wanted to add more visuals, such as a quick death animation for the snake, or a colorful power-up animation whenever an apple was eaten. More computational and graphical optimization would also be something to look into, especially because we ended up using only one PT thread and we do a lot of rectangle drawing, so we could have tried to implement that cpymemory trick.
