	<!-- CONCLUSION -->
	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">We found the implementation of game logic to be much more difficult than
		anticipated. We had predicted running into issues with running
		out of space on the Pico either as far as storing designs and sound effects or for running the game code. Designing
		with these constraints in mind made memory-intensive processes trick. However, with the right modular
		implementations, there was significantly more flash memory left over than we anticipated. Game logic was difficult
		to implement since there are many aspects that we hadn't actually considered before deciding on the game (wall
		detection, hitbox/hurtbox detection, etc).
		While we did not end up scaling the project back in any
		significant way from our expected result, there are a couple minor bugs as a result of corner cases which we did
		not discover with enough time to fully resolve.
	</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">As a result of developing the game program from very strong fundamentals and
		prioritizing
		organization and good coding practices, we were able to add features like interactable, additional enemies, and
		walking animation frames for the main character more easily than could have been if we had taken a more
		short-term approach to the game engine development. Specifically, we implemented the puzzle and the villager
		with whom the player must interact within the last few days of the project.
	</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">While the sound effects for the game feel complete with respect to a final
		project, plenty of
		work could be done to add sound functionality or clean up our current selections. Because we used less than half
		of the available flash space on the RP2040 in our current implementation, we could remaster this with a higher
		sampling frequency and better recording technology. One major constraint we faced with sound effects is that
		only one effect could be played at any given time. To fix this, we could develop a PIO program to average the
		sequencing of two DMA channels to be sent to the DAC. Because the background music is critically space
		constrained, we could expand our current music selection to include different songs for different locations
		in-game, or we could add new music parts to better match the sound generation of a true video game console.
	</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">As far as intellectual property, the inspiration and much of the design
		decisions were informed by the original game. However, none of the source code was referenced or looked at, and
		there are no attempts to profit off our game. All designs
		used in
		the game were ultimately designed by us, but many are heavily inspired by either the original Zelda game or
		other video games like Pokemon and Minecraft. The intention of this project was to create a game that
		would be fun to play and challenge ourselves to implement many of the
		features of a well-known game. We are not taking credit for the idea of the game or any of the
		concepts/features of the original or any adjust games. Furthermore, our 9-level demo level, while potentially
		impressive for a 4-week project completed by undergraduates, does not come close to the original game in complexity
		or scope.
