    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <i>
        A mouse that adapts to your needs.
    </i>
    <p>
        We designed an USB mouse that was no ordinary mouse. We did include the expected right 
        and left main mouse buttons, a scroll wheel, and an optical sensor to detect movement, 
        but we added more in the hardware and software to expand the mouse's functionality to 
        adapt to the user's needs. This included other components like a joystick and extra 
        rebindable buttons, other compile-time configurations such as the functions for the 
        buttons adjusting some constants in input receiving, and extra extensions such as different 
        operation modes and connection methods. Alongside these elements, the mouse shell strives to 
        be ergonomic through an adjustable tilt and potential interchangeable components. This is the 
        mouse that adapts to the user's needs both in software and its physical design.
