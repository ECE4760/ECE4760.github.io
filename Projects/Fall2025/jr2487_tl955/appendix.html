    <h2>AI Use</h2>
    <p>
      We used AI to assist with debugging and to generate reference implementations of certain functions.
      We reviewed, understood, and modified these functions to meet our specific requirements and implement the desired features.

    <h2>Additional Appendices: Task Delegation</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, Jeongyoon Rhee was responsible for real-time 3D cube visualization, consistent face mapping, and the solving algorithm.
      Tianyi Liu was responsible for application of GY271, the state machine, and the color input.
      We both improved the user interface and wrote the report.

    <h2>Conclusions (Summary)</h2>
    <p>
      The results met our expectations. Next time, we would like to infer the sixth face’s colors from the other five faces and eliminate flicker.
      Our design conformed to applicable standards by following established interface and timing conventions of the RP2040 subsystems.
      VGA timing was standard, I2C transactions followed device initialization/read/write sequences, and buttons were configured to avoid floating signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For intellectual property considerations, we did not reuse others’ designs or IP, did not reverse engineer designs, and did not face patent/trademark issues.
