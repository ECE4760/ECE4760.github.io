                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>“Pico-Pasture” is a model-based simulation of cattle movement over time periods, inspired by our mutual love for cows. The Lévy Walk Model is used to simulate how animals search for food, where most steps taken are short, representing cows grazing in a smaller area, while some steps are sudden and longer, representing a cow’s decision to leave a patch and explore a new area. Once a cow in the herd finds food, all of the cows in the herd switch to the Brownian motion model, which represents the cows moving randomly in small steps within a small region as they try to look for more food in the same region for a specific amount of time. Once the timer runs out, if they have not found more food, then the model switches back to the Lévy Walk Model; otherwise, they stay in the Brownian motion model. We simulated this model using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 for animating cows, food resources (hay), and static background animations, including a barn. </p>                
                <p>In order to simulate realistic herding behavior, we also modeled the herd having a “cow leader” and the rest of the cows being pulled towards the leader while also ensuring they maintain a minimum distance from each other to prevent unrealistic collisions. Another main component of our project includes a user panel with a joystick, two buttons, and two sliding potentiometers. The 4-directional joystick is used to control where food is placed on the screen, one button is used to control how fast the joystick cursor moves along the screen, and another button is used to drop the hay on the field where the joystick’s cursor is located. One sliding potentiometer changes how fast “time” changes in the simulation, ranging from minutes to years, which changes how fast the cows move on the screen as well. The other sliding potentiometer is used to change how much food is dropped at a time. Our project also includes sound when the hay is dropped and when a cow finds food. The bottom of the screen also incorporates live graphs, visually displaying the horizontal and vertical mean positions of the cows on the screen as well as the horizontal and vertical standard deviation of the herd.</p>
                <p>This project is a reflection of two scientific models put together that is visually useful and impactful, as it could provide cattle owners and agricultural scientists with information about cattle grazing patterns based on where they place food, which could influence their timeline for many farm operations. This could be integral to ensure that certain parts of the land aren’t completely avoided and die from a lack of grazing.</p>

                <h2>2. High Level Design</h2>
                <h3>Lévy Walk and Brownian Motion Overview</h3>
                <p>The rationale for our project is that overgrazing or undergrazing of specific areas can lead to soil degradation and wasted resources, and understanding the overall pattern of cattle movement over time based on where food resources are located can help prevent these issues. As mentioned in the summary section, the Lévy Walk Model is a commonly known movement pattern for many species, one of which is for cattle movement. The Brownian motion model represents another mode for once animals find food in a certain area, which is advantageous when resources are clumped together. By switching to the “exploiting” mode, the herd can increase its probability of finding nearby resources within the same area. The knowledge about these models and the mathematical application through code was sourced from the article The evolutionary maintenance of Lévy flight foraging (Campeau et al., 2022).</p>
                <h3 id="levy-logic">Lévy Walk Model (Searching Mode)</h3>
                <p><strong>Power-Law Equation:</strong></p>
                <p>The probability P(l) of a specific step length is decided by the exponent u:</p>
                <div class="math-block">$$P(l) \sim l^{-u}$$</div>
                <p>where u is the power law exponent and the “heaviness” of the tail is determined by u. For Levy flights, u usually sits between 1 and 3. If u is close to 1, there are extremely long, rare jumps (super heavy tail), but if u is large, close to 3, it behaves more like a normal distribution (Gaussian). </p>
                <p><strong>Inverse Transform Sampling:</strong></p>
                <p>To generate the steps in code, inverse transform sampling is used where a uniform random number r (between 0 and 1) is used to create appropriate steps:</p>
                <div class="math-block">$$l = l_{min} \cdot r^{-\frac{1}{u-1}}$$</div>
                <p>where l is the step length, lmin is the smallest possible step size, r is the uniform random number mentioned above, and u is the power law exponent as mentioned above. It is important to note that the majority of r values (0.1 to 1) create medium and small steps closer to lmin while r values that are smaller, such as 0.005 or 0.01, cause much larger steps. The result means that most step lengths will be very small, but occasionally the algorithm will generate a much larger step length representing the Lévy Walk Model. </p>
                <p><strong>Vector Math: </strong></p>
                <p>Once the distance (l) is calculated, it must be translated into two-dimensional coordinates for the VGA screen. The article mentions that the directions must be chosen randomly to ensure the walk is unbiased. </p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Randomized Direction: </strong>The code generates a random angle between 0 and 2𝜋 radians (360 degrees). </p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Polar to Cartesian Conversion: </strong>To find the new target (x, y), trigonometric identities are applied to the step length L  and the angle: </p>
                <div class="math-block">
                    $$x_{new} = x_{old} + l \cdot \cos(\theta)$$
                    $$y_{new} = y_{old} + l \cdot \sin(\theta)$$
                </div>
                <h3 id="brownian-logic">Brownian Motion Model (Exploiting Mode)</h3>
                <p>Once any cow in the herd finds food they all switch to the Brownian Motion Model in order to “exploit” the nearby resources in the same region.</p>
                <p><strong>Displacement Within a Narrow Range:</strong></p>
                <div class="math-block">$$\Delta x, \Delta y \in [-k, k]$$</div>
                <p>In our implementation k is set to be 2 so the maximum movement is capped at 2 pixels per frame, so the cattle effectively stay on top of the hay bale they are eating. The herd stays in the Brownian Motion Model mode for a certain time since they last found food and once that timer finishes they return back to searching mode following the Lévy Walk Model until they find food again.</p>

                <h3 id="herd-logic">Herd Cohesion and Separation</h3>
                <p>Another important part of the code is to simulate the herd-like movement with a “cow leader” and the rest of the cows moving cohesively. In order to do this, we used the information presented in Professor Adams’ Boids algorithm, augmented for a distributed consensus link on the course site. While the Lévy Walk Model and Brownian motion model dictate the individual foraging of the cows in the herd, the Boids rules establish a social ‘distributed consensus’ that allows the group to move as a unified herd. Specifically, we implemented a leader-follower model where a single cow (the leader) performs the efficient Lévy Walk search while the rest of the herd applies cohesion (grouping) logic to steer toward that leader. This is balanced by a separation rule, which calculates a push vector to maintain personal space between individuals. In terms of our project, this coordination of the herd to maintain herd-like movement without clumping models a realistic herd looking for food.</p>
                <p><strong>Consensus-Based Cohesion (Distributed Consensus)</strong></p>
                <p>Mathematical Equation: The cohesion velocity (V<sub>cohesion</sub>) is a vector pointing from a following cow’s position (P<sub>follower</sub>) toward the leader’s position (P<sub>leader</sub>), scaled by a centering factor constant (W<sub>cohesion</sub>) that was set by visual guessing and checking to see what looked the most realistic. The final equation is:</p>
                <div class="math-block">$$V_{cohesion} = (P_{leader} - P_{follower}) \cdot W_{cohesion}$$</div>
                
                <p><strong>Separation (Collision Avoidance)</strong></p>
                <p>Mathematical Equation: The avoidance velocity (V<sub>separation</sub>) is the sum of differences in coordinates between a specific cow (P<sub>self</sub>) and any neighbor (P<sub>neighbor</sub>) within its “protected range” and the sum is multiplied by a separation weight (W<sub>avoid</sub>) which is a constant set by visual guessing and checking as well to see what looked the most realistic. The final equation is: </p>
                <div class="math-block">$$V_{separation} = \sum (P_{self} - P_{neighbor}) \cdot W_{avoid}$$</div>
                <p>It is also important to note that the cows turn at the boundaries of the VGA screen using a hard boundaries set so their velocity and position is adjusted to stay on the screen, similar to what was done in the Galton board lab.</p>

                <p><strong>Overall Combination of Models</strong></p>
                <p>After the new vector for the foraging (either using the Lévy Walk Model or the Brownian Motion Model) is found it is added to the vectors for cohesion and separation which are all added to a cow’s old position. The sum of all of these vectors with the cow’s old position calculate the cow’s next position to move to:</p>
                <div class="math-block">$$Position_{new} = Position_{old} + V_{forage} + V_{cohesion} + V_{separation}$$</div>

                <h3 id="logical-structure">Logical Structure</h3>
                <p>The overall structure of the code includes definitions and global states at the top, fixed-point math macros for performance, and bit-packed arrays for animations such as the cows and the barn. The next part is the helper functions that handle the simulation’s underlying mathematics, such as calculating the Boids-style separation and cohesion vectors, determining Lévy Walk Model steps for searching, Brownian Motion Model steps, and creating for the hay dropping and mooing sounds of the cows when food is found. The next portion of our code includes two concurrent threads managed by Cornell’s protothreads library. One thread is dedicated to real-time hardware polling for the joystick and ADC inputs, while the other thread is dedicated to the graphics for rendering the VGA frame, updating the state machines for searching or exploiting, and calculating the statistics (horizontal and vertical mean and standard deviations). Lastly, the main function is the entry point of the program, where the system clock, VGA, and peripheral pins are all initialized before launching the thread scheduler to start the simulation in a continuous loop.</p>

                <h3 id="hard-soft-trade">Hardware/Software Tradeoffs</h3>
                <p>Our project is centered around balancing mathematical models for simulation with limited computational resources, so to maintain a smooth 30 fps VGA output while simulating the Lévy Walk Model or the Brownian Motion Model along with the cohesion and separation for herd-like behavior, we traded the convenience of floating-point math for the raw speed of 15-bit fixed-point arithmetic, similar to what we have done in prior class labs, which ensures the CPU can handle the trigonometry and square roots necessary for steering and distance calculations.</p>
                <p>In addition, the decision to use Cornell’s protothreads library, as we have also done in prior labs, represents the tradeoff of using a heavy Real-Time Operating System and simple sequential execution, which allows us to use multitasking to allow the Pico 2 to poll potentiometers and a joystick without interrupting the sensitive timing of the VGA signal.</p>
                <p>For creating the sounds for hay dropping and the cow moos, we used Direct Memory Access (DMA), similar to previous labs in the class. Using DMA means the system avoids using CPU cycles for sound synthesis, even though this means our moo and hay drop sounds are less complex since we are using pre-computed sine tables. Our project also maximizes the available memory by using bit-packed, long-long arrays for the animations, including the barn and tractor, which trades off easily readable code since the arrays are very long.</p>

                <p>After defining constants, the program includes two structs, one for defining the properties of each cow in the herd and another for defining each hay bale. For each cow, information such as its current position and last position (old_x and old_y) is used for erasing the sprite at the previous location. The cow information also includes a cow’s mode (whether it is in searching or exploiting mode), along with its next target x and y position and an exploit timer for how much longer it will be in exploiting mode if applicable. Similarly, for each hay bale, the struct defines its current coordinates and an “active” flag for whether it is still visible and can be eaten (1) or if it has already been eaten (0). An enum, “ForageState”, is also defined with the two states the cows in a herd are currently in:</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong>EXPLOITING: </strong>The cow has found food and is staying in a small area to “graze” (Brownian Motion Model).</p>
                <p>The next part of the program includes many global variables used throughout the rest of the helper functions and threads, such as the herd array which hold all of the cow objects, food_patches which hold all the food objects, user-controlled values like g_cow_speed which is the time scale for the simulation and g_food_drop_count which represents how many hay bales are going to be dropped for a single button press. Other global variables are also included, such as for tracking simulated time (years, months, days) and audio system variables such as DAC_data and DAC_data_moo, which store the sine tables.</p>
                <p>The next portion of the code includes large 2D arrays, such as COW_FRONT, BARN, HAY_FOOD, etc., which are stored as hex values. These are sprite data for the cow sprites and the static background animations, such as the barn. The animation code is explained below in the animation section.</p>
                

                <h3 id="model-herd">Modeling Herd Movement</h3>
                <p>The next integral part of the program is the helper functions. In order for the Lévy Walk Model and the Brownian Motion Model to be calculated, helper functions are used:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>get_levy_step:</strong> Generates a random step length with many small steps and occasional very long “jumps” as explained mathematically above in the high-level design section.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>set_new_levy_step: </strong>Calculates a random angle between [0.0, 0.1] and [0.0, 2π] and uses get_levy_step to set a new destination for the cow.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>clamp_target_to_screen: </strong>Ensures the randomly generated target positions for the cows in the herd stay within the grass area (VGA screen dimensions without colliding with the graphs or static background animations).</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>find_brownian_motion: </strong>Generates small movements (1-2 pixels) for a period of time, which is called when a cow finds food, and the cow is now in the EXPLOITING state. </p>
                <p>The calculations within these helper functions were programmed using the mathematical models explained in the article The evolutionary maintenance of Lévy flight foraging (Campeau et al., 2022), which details animal foraging behavior based on the Lévy Walk Model and the Brownian Motion Models.</p>
                <p>Other helper functions, such as <strong>spawnCow, init_food, draw_food, wallsAndEdges</strong>, are used to initialize and display cows and food at the start of the simulation, along with drawing food when the joystick cursor is placed at a location, and the drop food button is pressed, and ensuring the cows stay within the bounds of the VGA screen.</p>
                <p>The helper function <strong>check_and_eat_food</strong> checks if a cow’s x and y position are close enough to a food’s ex and y position, and if so, the “moo” sound is played, and the food is deactivated (active flag is set to 0, and the food is no longer visible). The <strong>resolve_collisions</strong> helper function prevents cows from overlapping with each other, so if two cows are too close, for example, it calculates an “overlap” vector and pushes them apart. </p>
                <p>The two helper functions used for calculating the cohesion and separation of the cows in the herd are the <strong>calculate_grouping</strong> function, where all cows (except the “leader” cow at index 0) steer toward the position of the leader, as explained in the high-level design section above. Similarly, in the <strong>calculate_separation</strong> function, if a cow gets too close to its neighbors, it steers away to avoid crowding, and the calculations for that are also explained in the high-level design section above. Professor Adams’ webpage regarding the Boids algorithm augmented for a distributed consensus link on the course site.</p>
                <p>The <strong>update_cow_movement</strong> function is important because this serves as the “brain” of each cow. It combined the foraging logic from the two models along with the cohesion and separation calculations to determine exactly where a cow should move in the next frame. The function begins by deciding how the cow should move based on which state it is in. </p>
                <p>If a cow is in the <strong>SEARCHING</strong> state: The cow is looking for food using the Lévy Walk Model, and it moves toward a target_x and target_y that was previously calculated using the distribution. First, the distance to the target is calculated using the sqrtfix15 function, and if the cow is within TARGET_REACHED_DIST (3 pixels) of its goal, it calls set_new_levy_target(c) to pick a new spot on the map. To ensure the cow moves at a consistent speed regardless of how far the target is, the code “normalizes” the vector, similar to the balls falling through the Galton board in lab 2.</p>
                <p>If a cow is in the <strong>EXPLOITING</strong> state: The cow has found a food patch and has switched to “grazing” mode using the Brownian Motion Model. The find_brownian_motion function is called, which generates tinier steps (+/- 2 pixels) for each cow to move within to find nearby food. The exploit_timer is decremented, and once the timer hits zero, the cow has “finished” searching in that patch of the field and switched back to the SEARCHING state. </p>
                <p>After deciding its individual goal, the cow adjusts its movement based on the rest of the herd. This is where the <strong>calculate_separation</strong> and <strong>calculate_grouping</strong> functions are called. If any of the neighboring cows are closer than SEPARATION_DIST, then a vector is created pointing away from them, which prevents overlapping. If the current cow is the leader (index == 0) in the array of cow objects, it ignores calculating a cohesion vector; otherwise, a vector is calculated pointing towards the leader’s coordinates. These calculations are more thoroughly explained in the high level design section above. A final cow’s position is calculated to be the sum of the foraging vector (based on one of the two models), separation vector, and grouping vector using the x and y components of the vector. </p>
                
                <h3 id="sound-design">Sound</h3>
                <p>The next portion of our program includes functions for creating the sounds for hay dropping and the “moo” sound when a cow finds food. We reused and modified our code from lab 2, where the hay dropping sound was the same sound as the balls hitting the pegs in the Galton board. However, we modified a new, longer sine table to incorporate a moo sound. Both sounds were created using direct memory access (DMA) to stream audio data to a DAC via SPI.</p>
                <p>Labs 1 and 2 helped prepare us to include audio in our program, as we wanted a sound when food dropped and a “moo” sound when food was eaten. We used the MCP4822 DAC and sine tables to achieve these sounds. The DAC connections are as follows, and can be seen in our complete hardware schematic below:</p>
                <p class="indent">PIN_SCK is the serial clock</p>
                <p class="indent">PIN_MISO sends data from DAC</p>
                <p class="indent">PIN_MOSI receives sample values and sends them to the DAC</p>
                <p class="indent">PIN_CS activates the device so that the DAC receives values via MOSI</p>
                <p>Configured on channel A, this takes our digital sample, the sin function for our “moo,” and converts it to analog voltages using an SPI channel, which then goes through an amplifier and speaker since our DAC is powered by 3.3 V.</p>
                <p><strong>Hay dropping sound: </strong>Our hay dropping sound is the same function as the plunk sound from Lab 2: Galton Board, shown in the following figure. The sine_table_size is equal to 256.</p>
                <div class="math-block">$$f(x) = 2047\sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{\text{sine_table_size}}\right) + 2047$$</div>
                <p><strong>Moo sound: </strong>Using a simple sine function like we used for the hay drop sound, we were struggling with getting a frequency low and clear enough to sound like a moo. We widened the sine table to 50,000 so that the sound would last longer, then added a parabola with defined start and end frequencies, 0.004, and peak frequency, 0.015, to get our precise MOOOOO!</p>
                <div class="math-block">$$1000\sin\left(\int_{0}^{t} (3(0.015 - 0.004)(\tau - \tau^2) + 0.004)d\tau\right) + 1000$$</div>

                <h3 id="proto-controls">Protothread_Controls</h3>
                <p>After the helper programs, the next main section of our program includes two threads that run concurrently, the protothread_controls thread that runs constantly to poll hardware, including two sliders (ADC), a four-directional joystick, and two buttons:</p>
                <p>Two buttons, two sliders (sliding potentiometers), and one joystick are included to give the program an interactive component. The buttons add food and adjust the speed of the food cursor, the sliders adjust the time speed and the amount of food dropped at once, and the joystick moves the food cursor.</p>
                <p>The food cursor button uses a switch statement with three cases: case 0 (default) where the joystick moves the cursor 5 pixels at a time, case 1 where the joystick moves the cursor 15 pixels at a time, and case 2 where the joystick moves the cursor 1 pixel continuously so the joystick can be held in one direction and the cursor will smoothly move in that direction until the joystick is released.</p>
                <p>The drop food button adds to food_patches and increments our variable NUM_FOOD that represents the total amount of food on screen at once (which also decrements when a cow munches on it!). The amount of food added to food_patches is adjusted by the corresponding slider. The item in food_patches is then set to active so that it is detectable by cows, and the available drop area is limited to below the barn and above the graphs.</p>
                <p>The other slider or sliding potentiometer reads a raw voltage via the RP2040’s ADC and maps that value to the simulation’s “clock”. The code selects the ADC input tied to the slider and gets a value between 0 and 4095. This value is then “clamped” and mathematically mapped to a floating-point range (0.2 to 5.0), which is converted into a fixed point and saved in the global variable called g_cow_speed. This variable is later used in protothread_graphics to update the label for elapsed time and the speed of the cows moving on the screen.</p>

                <h3 id="proto-graph">Protothread_Graphics</h3>
                <p>The other thread is the protothread_graphics thread, which holds the core loop used for our visual simulation. In this thread, cows are erased at their old positions in order to be drawn at their new positions, the update_cow_movement helper function is also called in order to calculate each cow’s new target position based on the current model it is using (Lévy Walk Model or Brownian Motion Model). The animations for the cow and the other static animations, such as the barn, are handled:</p>

                <p class="center-text">Final 640x480 8-bit color VGA screen design including example food and cows.</p>
                <p>For the animations part of our project, we used the Mandelbrot_Set demo code from Hunter Adams’s github repository.</p>
                <p><strong>Creation and organization of sprite arrays</strong></p>
                <p>All visual components on the VGA screen are coded as sprites, stored in constant arrays initialized at the top of the code. In order to save time and space in the code, each array input holds 7 pixels, 2 hex digits per pixel. Items in the background, such as the barn, trees, and tractor, are drawn once in main while animated components, such as the cows and food, are drawn in as needed, like when new food is dropped. All images were drawn by Francesca on the Pixilart iPad app, converted to hex codes using the website Online PNG Tools, then put into the following Python program to print the sprites in an array format for coding in C:</p>
                <img src="python_code.jpg">
                <p>The printed output from Python is used in the following example of one of our cow sprites, COW_FRONT, that is displayed when cows are moving down on the screen.</p>

<p>This array corresponds to the following image when displayed on the VGA screen.</p>
                <img src="cow.jpg">
<p><strong>Displaying sprites to screen</strong></p>
<p>The following C code is an example of drawing one of our cow sprites, COW_FRONT, to the screen:</p>
<pre><code>for (int r = 0; r < 28; r++) {
  for (int c = 0; c < 2; c++) {               
    long long block = COW_FRONT[r][c];
    for (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {           
      int shift = (6 - j) * 8;            
      int pixel = (block >> shift) & 0xFF;
      if (pixel != 0x1E) {                
        int x = fix2int15(herd[i].x) - 7 + c*7 + j;            
        int y = fix2int15(herd[i].y) - 14 + r;                  
        drawPixel(x, y, pixel);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code loops through each row and column (remember each column is 7 pixels wide, so a length of 2 means 14 pixels!), takes an input from the COW_FRONT array, then separates it into each group of 2 hex digits and draws the pixel with the corresponding color hex code in the correct position. The position is determined by taking the current x-value and y-value of the desired cow, subtracting half of the array width (14/2 = 7) from the x position and half of the array height (28/2 = 14) to center the image, and then adding the index of the current row or column. Since each input in the array is read from least to most significant bit, the code has to flip which pixel we draw first so that the image displays left to right and up to down. This is achieved with shifting, then using AND with 0xFF. 0x1E corresponds to transparent in our arrays, so when the pixel is equal to 1E, the code skips drawPixel.</p>
<p><strong>Cows changing directions</strong></p>
<p>While working on this project, we had a shocking revelation: cows, like many other animals, look in the direction that they’re moving! We implemented this aspect by adding three more sprite arrays: COW_BACK for when the cow is moving up, COW_RIGHT for when the cow is moving to the right, and COW_LEFT for when the cow is moving to the left. The following is a mix of C code and some pseudo-code that accurately describes our method:</p>
           <p>A cow in our herd can only move in one direction at a time: left, right, up, or down. To determine which direction to go, we first determine if the cow will be moving horizontally or vertically.</p>     
<pre><code>fix15 change_cow_x = herd[i].x - herd[i].old_x;
fix15 change_cow_y = herd[i].y - herd[i].old_y;
</code></pre>
<p>The variables change_cow_x and change_cow_y hold the difference between the previous and current cow positions. If the change in x-values is larger than the change in y-values, we know that the cows should be moving left or right. If the change in x is positive, the cow should move to the right, but if it is negative, the cow should move to the left. If the change in y-values is larger than the change in x-values and the change in y-value is positive, then the cow should move down; if it is negative, then the cow should move up.
</p>
<pre><code>if (abs(change_cow_x) > abs(change_cow_y)) {
  herd[i].direction = (change_cow_x > 0) ? 3 : 2;
  if (change_cow_x > 0) {
    Draw COW_RIGHT
  }
  else {
    Draw COW_LEFT
  }
}
else {
  herd[i].direction = (change_cow_y > 0) ? 0 : 1;
  if (change_cow_y > 0) {
    Draw COW_FRONT
  }
  else {
    Draw COW_BACK
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we’ve established how to draw our cows in different directions, we also have to erase them! This is a bit trickier, as we are erasing the previous cows’ positions AND directions. The following lines, which are located in the loops that draw the cows, set an individual cow’s direction value depending on which direction they were just drawn in.</p>
<pre><code>herd[i].direction = (change_cow_x > 0) ? 3 : 2;
herd[i].direction = (change_cow_y > 0) ? 0 : 1;
</code></pre>
<p>A 0 is down, 1 is up, 2 is to the left, and 3 is to the right. We can erase the cows at the old position and direction since these values are updated when drawing a cow’s new position. Our code checks the value of the direction and draws either COW_FRONT (0), COW_BACK (1), COW_LEFT (2), or COW_RIGHT (3) replacing the pixel color with our grass color, MED_GRASS.
</p>
<h4 id="time">Time</h4>
<p>This global variable set in the protothread_controls thread is used to scale the movement vectors of the cows, where a higher slider value results in larger per-frame position updates, making the cows move faster. The speed also adds to a time accumulator; as the cows move faster, the simulation’s “clock” accelerates, causing the hours, days, and years displayed on the VGA screen to tick by at a vastly increased rate, which connects the physical cow movement to the passage of simulation time. This AI-generated chart explains the calculation breakdown of time per speed setting in our code:</p>
                <img src="time.jpg">

<h4 id="stats">Mean and Standard Deviation Graphs</h4>
<p>Lastly, the graphics thread manages the calculations of the vertical and horizontal mean position and standard deviation of the herd and draws real-time line graphs at the bottom of the screen. The mean position is calculated by simply summing the horizontal or vertical positions and dividing by the number of cows in the herd. Using that mean, the vertical and horizontal  variances are calculated, and from the vertical and horizontal variances, the vertical and horizontal standard deviations are calculated using the equations below:</p>
<p><strong>Mean: </strong>(N represented the number of cows stored in g_num_cows)</p>
<div class="equation-container">
  <p>The mean of x and y is calculated as:</p>
  
  \[
    \mu_x = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_i}{N}, \quad \mu_y = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i}{N}
  \]
</div>
<p>mean_x_f = sum_x / g_num_cows for the horizontal mean </p>
<p>mean_y_f = sum_y / g_num_cows for the vertical mean </p>
<p><strong>Variance: </strong></p>
<div class="equation-container">
  \[
    \sigma_x^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (x_i - \mu_x)^2}{N}, \quad \sigma_y^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (y_i - \mu_y)^2}{N}
  \]
</div>
<p>var_sum_x += (diff_x * diff_x) for the horizontal variance</p>
<p>var_sum_y += (diff_y * diff_y) for the vertical variance</p>
<p><strong>Standard Deviation: </strong></p>
<div class="equation-container">
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{} & \sigma_x = \sqrt{\sigma_x^2}, & \sigma_y = \sqrt{\sigma_y^2}
  \end{aligned}
  \]
</div>
<p>std_x_f = sqrt(var_sum_x / g_num_cows) for the horizontal standard deviation</p>
<p>std_y_f = sqrt(var_sum_y/ g_num_cows) for the vertical standard deviation</p>
<p>These calculations and corresponding graphs for the means and the standard deviations are updated every frame to show the live statistical tracking of the herd. </p>

<h4 id="main">Main Function</h4>
<p>The last portion of our program includes the main function, which is where, as mentioned briefly above in the high level design section, the system clock is configured to 150 MHz, the VGA display is initialized, and the SPI and SMA channels are prepared for the audio system. After setting up the ADC for the sliding potentiometers and configuring the GPIO pins for the joystick and buttons, the static, non-moving background animations are drawn, such as the barn, windmill, and trees. Then, the main function seeds the random number generator, spawns the initial cows and food patches, and adds the protothread_graphics and protothread_controls tasks to the scheduler to begin the interactive simulation.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware Components</h3>
<p><strong>Complete Hardware Schematic</strong></p>
                <img src="hardware.jpg">
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Pico2</strong></p>
<p>With the Pico1, we had 1 byte for every 2 pixels (for example, FF would be two white pixels) but we wanted to change to 1 byte for every 1 pixel in order to go from 4-bit color to 8-bit color while maintaining a 640x480 screen size. The Pico1 does not have enough ram for this change, so we decided to switch to the Pico2 so that our cows could live in vibrant color.</p>
<p>Changes in Software:</p>
<p>To account for the increase in the number of GPIO pins as detailed below, the number of out pins in rgb.pio had to be increased to 8. No clock division occurs. We also had to modify our VGA graphics .c file. We doubled RGB_ACTIVE to be the width of the screen, doubled the length of pixel array TXCOUNT to 640*480=307200, and ensure that memset functions always used 640 instead of 320. The board also had to be changed from pico to pico2 in VS Code. Other than this, no other software changes were necessary.</p>
<p>Changes in Hardware and VGA Connections:</p>
<p>With the RP2040 Pico1, we had 2 green GPIOs, 1 red GPIO, and 1 blue GPIO. With the RP2350 Pico2, we doubled the number of GPIOs being used to 3 green, 3 red, and 2 blue. This meant we had to move our wires to the opposite side of the breadboard, and we couldn’t use the PCB we had built in a previous lab with the resistors included. The following image shows an LTSpice schematic from the demo code page “319x240 VGA 256-color,” written by Hunter Adams and converted to 319x240 with 256 colors by Bruce Land.</p>
                <img src="gpio.jpg">
<p>The resistors connected to ground (100Ω and 150Ω) are not included on the breadboard as the VGA plug has built in resistances of around 75Ω, which ensures the correct signal level will be read. The other 220Ω, 330Ω, 680Ω, and 1000Ω resistors were wired on the breadboard with the corresponding GPIOs going in and the VGA wires (to be used in the plug as seen below) coming out.</p>
                <img src="vga.jpg">
<p>VSYNC is connected to GPIO 17 and HSYNC is connected to GPIO 16.</p>
<p><strong>User Panel Controls</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the hardware schematic above, the food speed button is wired to GPIO 2, the drop food button to GPIO 28, the food slider to GPIO 27, the time slider to GPIO 26, the left joystick to GPIO 21, the right joystick to GPIO 20, the down joystick to GPIO 19, and the up joystick to GPIO 18. The sliding potentiometers also require a connection to 3.3V through a resistor so that a voltage divider is present and the power doesn’t short when set to 0 ohms. The time slider connects to a 10kΩ resistor, and the food slider connects to a 47kΩ resistor. These resistances were given on the body of the sliding potentiometers.</p>
<p><strong>Tricky Parts to Write</strong></p>
<p>One of the most difficult parts to write was the changes to achieve 8-bit color on a 640x480 VGA screen. Many hours were spent changing different values in rgb.pio and our VGA graphics C file to accommodate the change from pico1 to pico2. At first, we had all 256 colors but only on half of the screen, then the whole screen was tiled 4 times, then finally we were able to achieve all 256 colors on the whole screen.
Something else that was a bit tricky was the control function. With so many physical components that interacted with each other, we had to make sure that they were working properly. For example, one of the buttons changes the speed of the cursor movement controlled by the joystick. It was a bit difficult to set up the different cases and make sure the joystick cursor was being properly updated.
</p>
<p><strong>Things We Tried but Didn't Work</strong></p>
<p>We wanted a slider to change the number of cows on the screen, and tried to implement this early in our programming. Even with the cows just facing forward at this point, they were not properly being erased when we moved the slider down to reduce the number of cows on the screen. While we had ideas about how to fix this, we felt that fixing this bug would be time consuming and even more complicated once the different cow direction sprites were implemented. Therefore, we decided to scrap it in favor of changing the amount of food (hay bales) dropped at a time instead of using the same slider.</p>
<p>Another roadblock we ran into was having a very limited amount of colors we could use with the Pico1. While we completed all of the basic modeling using boids to represent the cows and food, we wanted to incorporate animations. Therefore, we took on the challenge of switching to the Pico2, which includes a lot more color options (8-bit color) and allowed our animations to look a lot nicer.</p>
<p><strong>AI Usage</strong></p>
<p>While converting the mathematical Lévy Walk Model we ran into issues with the way we were implementing the logic. We had to scrap our “rough draft” code and go back to the drawing board. Therefore, a few times we used generative AI to find the gaps in our implementation or cases we weren’t considering, and this helped us to reframe our idea about how to implement the code and make it much simpler. For example, we were able to implement the model with two helper “get” and “set” functions, which made it a lot easier than implementing everything all in one function.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we had bugs in our code, and we couldn’t seem to pinpoint where in the code the bug was occurring, we used generative AI a few times to figure out what was the issue. For example, one major bug that caused a roadblock in our progress was that when some of the cows found food, the model (indicated through the label) wasn’t switching to the Brownian Motion Model, but sometimes it would. At first, we thought this was an issue with our label, but after triple-checking that it wasn’t, we were very confused. After a lot of testing, including changing different parameters like testing with only one cow, which seemed to work perfectly fine, we asked generative AI to check specific sections of our code we suspected had an issue, including the update_cow_movement function. After some back and forth, AI eventually led us to find out that our implementation was only checking if the leader found food, not if the other cow objects in the array found food. After AI was able to help us find the issues, we were able to easily fix this issue by iterating through all the cow objects in the array.
</p>
<p>Lastly, generative AI provided us with an HTML template from which we modified to build the webpage for our final report. Generative AI also helped us create some nicely formatted graphics for our webpage, such as the table explaining the time calculations when using the slider, and updating the label. It also helped us format equations we used to more professionally display on our final web page here.

                <h2>4. Results of the Design</h2>
                <p>To test our program, we tried adjusting the sliders to the extremes, pressing buttons at the same time, moving our joystick to the edges of the screen and placing food there, seeing if cows would run off the screen, and allowing our program to run until there was no food left to see what the cows would do. Through this testing, not many changes were made other than ensuring that food could not be placed over the graphs, and the food cursor could not go up past the barn or down past the graphs.
</p>
<p>
Our final animation had no flickering or hesitation. The interactive components, such as timing and food drops, were very responsive; there was no noticeable pause between pressing a button and seeing a result. We also maintained a framerate of 30 frames per second, with the animated components such as the cows moving smoothly.
</p>
<p>Our mathematical models were accurate, seen by the cows' movement that aligned with what it should be. Additionally, our final moo sound was pretty accurate to what a real moo sounds like, and we had the professor and other students listen to the moo and say that it was accurate. The video signal timing was accurate, the pico2 has much more space to maintain our 30 fps.</p>
<p>Safety was not much of a concern in our design. We made sure the cows were bound by the edges of the screen so they couldn’t run off and get themselves into dangerous situations. The program is very usable by us; we understand the controls that we coded, and there are no pauses or jumps. Our physical control panel, as described above, is set in a wooden box from a previous semester’s project. This makes our game easy to use with large buttons and a large joystick, even if a person has never played a video game before. Usability could be increased slightly by adding labels to the buttons, but it is pretty simple to learn which button does what. The number of cows on the screen is hardcoded, so while changing the number of cows is intuitive to us, it may not be to someone else. We tried to improve this with the cow slider, but ultimately were unable so we set the default to 10 cows, which is enough to show our mathematical models. Usability could slightly improve in this area, but it was not a large concern for us.

                <h2>5. Conclusions</h2>
                <p>Overall, our design not only met our expectations but exceeded them. Our priority for our project was to implement the Lévy Walk Model and Brownian Model, as well as the cohesion and separation of the herd, to make the simulation more realistic. Therefore, the animation aspect of our project was something we wanted to keep simple, with the assumption that we wouldn’t have a lot of time since implementing the models would take up most of our time. However, with good time management, we were able to complete the implementation of the models a lot earlier than we expected, but the cows and the food were simply empty circles or “boids”. </p>
                <p>We also soon realized that color would be a difficult limitation to work around to create nice animations for cows, food, and the background while still using the Pico 1. While we had an idea about switching to the Pico 2 brought up by Professor Adams and Professor Land, we thought of it as more of an extension if we had time. However, we were able to transition our working model to the Pico 2 and create animations using 8-bit color. Not only that, we were able to add sound and live plotting of mean and standard deviation statistics for the herd. The implementation of these extensions are what exceeded our expectations and are what transformed our project to be a comprehensive project incorporating a lot of different aspects. </p>
                <p> Something we wish we could’ve done differently next time is create a custom PCB in place of the panel. This way, the four-directional joystick, sliding potentiometers, and buttons would look more professional. However, with the time constraint to order parts and the modifications we made to our project, we are still happy with the panel we incorporated. With more time, we also would’ve liked to add more features, such as placing water or changing fence barriers, along with food, to see how the herd reacts. We also would’ve liked to add a milk production model to our simulation to see how where resources are placed can directly impact milk production. </p>
                <p>Our design as a whole incorporates many aspects of what we have learned in labs throughout the semester and new aspects that many students have not yet done or worked with. We worked specifically with the Lévy Walk Model and the Brownian Motion Model while incorporating cohesion and separation. Combining these models and converting them to code to create a simulation encompasses what a CDE course, as Professor Adams has mentioned, means. We created a visual representation of these mathematical models and vector physics. In addition, we implemented hardware through the interactive features, including buttons, sliding potentiometers, and a four-directional joystick. We also transitioned from using a Pico 1 to a Pico 2 to incorporate 8 bit color, which is something not a lot of students in the past have worked with. The incorporation of sound and display of statistics displays how multi-faceted our project was and why it conforms to the applicable standards of the course.</p>
                <p>Of course, we did not come up with the Lévy Walk Model, the Brownian Motion Model, or the base logic behind cohesion and separation of the herd with a leader. We used online sources, including a scientific article: The evolutionary maintenance of Lévy flight foraging (Campeau et al., 2022) as a guide for understanding and implementing the Lévy Walk Model and the Brownian Motion Model. We also used resources for the ECE 4760 course site, including Professor Adams’ link: Boids algorithm - augmented for distributed consensus, and Professor Land’s link: Explaining RP2040 256 VGA. We also utilized the Mandelbrot_Set demo code from Hunter Adams’s GitHub repository. We also reused our own code from past lab assignments heavily, including creating sounds with direct memory access and collision detection with boids from lab 2.</p>

                <h2>8. Team Member Tasks</h2>
                <p><strong>Kirti Bagepalli: </strong>She was in charge of implementing the Lévy Walk Model and the Brownian Motion Model. She also implemented the logic for the cohesion and separation of the herd following the “cow leader”. She also implemented the timing calculations when the slider changes the time lapsing, impacting the speed of the cows as well. She also created the graphs at the bottom of the screen to display the live statistical means and standard deviations of the herd (vertically and horizontally). Overall, she did a lot of the mathematical portion of the project and the base of what the animations were built off of. She also did a lot of the initial setup of the project along with planning and breaking down tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Francesca Piccioni: </strong>She was in charge of all animation designs, drawing them on her iPad and converting them to arrays usable by C. She did physical controls that added food, changing the food cursor speed, and the joystick to move the cursor. She did not do the time slider or the food amount slider. She handled all hardware and wiring, cleaning up the wires so it would fit better in the wood box. She converted the code from Pico1 to Pico2 in order to achieve 256 colors on a 640x480 VGA screen. Overall, she did a lot of the animations and designs to make our program visually appealing.</p>
                <p>Both members collaborated on creating the sound creation.</p>
