    "DigiDrum is a combination of a virtual and physical emulator of a three instrument drumset, allowing users to create realistic and responsive musical noise by “striking” non-existent drums and cymbals with real life drum sticks and a kick pedal. In other words, although a user holding the drum sticks and tapping the kick pedal may not be hitting actual drums and hi-hats, the same motion that would cause the instrument to make noise in real life causes noise to be played on our drumset simulation system."

    "This behavior is achieved by tracking the acceleration of both drumsticks separately, with software constantly filtering through all the noisy movement of each drumstick until it registers an acceleration pattern that corresponds to a striking motion. An MPU6050 on either drumstick allows the user to passively send data to the RP2040 about what sort of motion they are currently engaged in, creating a user experience that strongly feels like playing a real drumset. For our project, the drumstick in the user’s right-hand was associated with a hi-hat and the left-hand corresponded with a snare drum. So upon triggering a right handed strike, a hi-hat noise came out of the speakers, and a snare noise came out of a different set of speakers when the left hand made a striking motion. The kick pedal itself outputs a small electric pulse when struck, so this signal was amplified and used in our system to trigger a bass drum sound to be played through a subwoofer. "

This sort of simulation is done for many aspects of life: flight simulators, virtual reality and augmented reality technology, and even some videogames and arcade games. These sorts of systems blur the lines between the barrier of the physical and digital worlds, and it can allow for interesting and novel user experiences. In particular, we decided to develop a simulated drumset because of universality. While percussion doesn’t always take the form of a standard drumset, the rhythm and music of percussion instruments can be heard throughout history and across cultures. Additionally, it’s just plain fun to make loud noises, even if they don’t sound good!"

This ISR, named “drum_check_irq”,  interrupts whatever code is taking up compute, pausing the rest of the system every 1500 microseconds so that the ISR can go through its own logic. This interrupt frequency of ~666 Hz was chosen such that it was fast enough to gather more than enough acceleration data in order to accurately register a user's strike of an instrument, but slow enough to allow the ISR to be able to successfully communicate with both of the IMUs.

    "Within the ISR, there is logic to determine whether or not a user has “struck” either a drum or the hi-hat. This is done by first reading the z-acceleration from both IMUs, low passing those values in order to reduce noise, and then adding them to their own ring buffer depending on which drumstick the IMU was attached to. After adding both the left hand data and the right hand data to their respective ring buffers, we then send the data through a comb filter, which essentially sifts through the acceleration data in order to find a specific pattern of values that we recognize happens whenever a user makes a striking motion. If the output of this comb filter is larger than a programmer defined magnitude, then this signals to the system that the user did in fact intend to strike an instrument, as opposed to just waving the drumsticks around. Upon a valid striking motion, the ISR triggers the DMA to playback the corresponding noise. If the user made a right-handed strike, the DMA outputs a hi-hat noise to the DAC, and if it was a left-handed strike, the DMA sends out the data corresponding with a snare noise. Similarly, when the kick stand was kicked, we sent the electrical pulse generated through an amplifier and a voltage divider and sent the result of the amplification to a GPIO on RP2040. The amplification process, done through a comparator circuit design as shown in Figure 9, was necessary because the kick stand was unable to produce a large enough voltage for the RP2040 to register it as a logical high input. The original output from the kick stand and the amplified output can be seen in Figures 1 and 2. With the addition of the amplification, after going through the logic of both the right and left handed drumsticks, the ISR then checked to see if the GPIO associated with the kick pedal was high. In the case that it was, the ISR signalled to the DMA to send the data for a bass sound to the subwoofers. At the very end of the ISR, it semaphored into a protothread that graphed all of this data."

    "The “protothread_vga_display” actually didn’t run on its own, and was triggered to be run through a semaphore at the end of the ISR after all the acceleration and strike data had been updated. This protothread used the VGA display to create one of two screens. The first is a screen with two graphs on it used for visualization of data about the system. The top graph displayed the realtime acceleration data from both drumsticks, allowing users to visualize how their movements are interpreted by the IMU. On the graph below this one, the output of the comb filter for both hands were displayed on the same graph. It was important to display both of these data during hte making of the system because it allowed us to make a valid instrument strike that “felt” correct, and then look at the corresponding acceleration and combfilter data to determine how we should have the RP2040 interpret the data. This took many trials, and this process will be discussed in a later section. The second screen associated with this protothread displayed a simple, three instrument, pixelated drum set. Above the drumset, there were two horizontal lines, and different colored balls would fall from the top of the screen at a steady pace until they entered the space between the two horizontal lines. This was the game mode of DigiDrum, with the goal that when a ball that is hovering over a specific instrument enters the space between the two horizontal lines, the user should strike that same instrument either with their drumsticks of the foot pedal at the same instant. This allowed for users to time themselves, as well as practice drumming to a specified beat, with the VGA display doubling as a metronome. When the user struck any of the instruments, they lit up with different colors depending on the instrument. The protothread determines which VGA screen to draw depending on the state of the finite state machine discussed earlier in the “protothread_ui”.\n"

This was implemented so that we could isolate the I2C devices from the protothreads so that they don’t latch each other in the case that the I2C communication fails. In order to initialize the I2C devices, we set up GPIO pins that were used to power the I2C devices so that they would turn off when the RP2040 was rebooting and wouldn’t cause the system to hang when no I2C address was found. On Core 0, however, there was no I2C initialization, but that is where the IRQ setup for the ISR occurred, as well as setting up the process for the DMA to send audio data to the DAC. Because each DAC has two outputs, and we wanted three independent sounds, we needed to use two separate DACs that were each on their own SPI channel. This allowed for users to play all three instruments (snare, hi-hat, and bass) at the same time, and none of the sounds would interrupt the other, creating a realistic feel."

    "One hardware/software tradeoff that we chose to make was to not have the drumsticks and foot pedal be completely, physically isolated from the RP2040 that controls the VGA screen. This could have been done by giving each drumstick its own RP2040 and IMU, as well as giving the foot pedal its own RP2040. Then these three additional microcontrollers could have communicated with the main microcontroller that controlled the VGA display, allowing for completely isolated physical systems and giving the user a full range of motion. However, we chose to wire both of the drumsticks and the footpedal directly to one RP2040 because, realistically, a user wouldn’t need full range of motion in both hands when playing a drumset; they just need to be able to play in front of them and sometimes to the side. Additionally, including this extra hardware onto the drumsticks could have made them awkward to hold and possibly throw off the balance of the stick, which may feel odd to the user. Therefore, we sacrificed the elegance of physically isolated systems and the software design for communication between RP2040’s for a simpler hardware design that met the requirements of our project"

    "Overall, the hardware design intentionally favors a simple controller architecture as the sensors remain lightweight on the drumsticks, and all computation and audio streaming happens on the Pico. The tradeoff is that the sticks and pedal are tethered by wires rather than being fully wireless, but the result is a reliable, low-cost build that is easy to reproduce on a breadboard while still feeling responsive and realistic to play."

    "One of the main things that we had to implement but that did not initially work for quite some time was figuring out what set of conditions should the RP2040 be looking for when attempting to determine if the user has made a valid striking motion. This was an issue for us because we had not anticipated that when the user is bringing the drumstick up, to subsequently bring it down and make a strike, their arm oscillates a little bit at the top of this movement where the armspeed is momentarily zero. This oscillation, when looked at on the VGA graph, had the exact same shape that we had associated with a valid strike motion, but it was obvious to the user that it wasn’t. Similarly, during a valid strike motion, there too was some oscillation, causing part of the acceleration data to look instead like an upwards strike, not a downwards one. So when the drumstick was moving up and stopped, which shouldn’t trigger a sound to play because the user has “struck” anything, the acceleration data looked like it had moved up, but then immediately afterwards there was a small downward acceleration that made it look like the user had tried to strike an instrument. The opposite issue was true when the user was actually trying to strike the instrument. For better visualizations of this, it may be helpful to look at the top graph in Figure 4, as well as Figures 6, 7, and 8."

    "Initially, we thought we could avoid this issue by just using the acceleration data from the IMU, waiting for when the z-acceleration became higher than some arbitrary threshold. Our assumption was that the z-acceleration wouldn’t get higher than the threshold unless it was moving down quickly, as would happen during a strike. However, we found that this was an unreliable method of registration and would sometimes miss valid strikes and register invalid ones. In order to visualize how the upwards and downwards movement of the drumsticks affected the acceleration and gyroscope data, please refer to Figures 6 and 7. For a visualization of when an invalid strike might actually be registered as a valid strike with this method, refer to Figure 8."

    "We then tried to additionally use the gyroscope data to help differentiate between a general upwards motion and a downwards one. Here, too, we ran into the issue that its success was never fully accurate. After this we tried a completely new method, where we kept drawing data from the IMU, and once the z-acceleration had gone from below equilibrium to above equilibrium or vice versa, we would register a valid strike or an invalid strike, respectively, then we would either register of not register a strike and ignore the next interval of data points. The idea here was that we did not expect users of our system to attempt to drum too fast, and since part of the acceleration data that messed with our logic was always the second half of the data, if we then register the beginning motion as a valid strike, then count is as a strike and don’t take measurements for a certain amount of time. Similarly, if the motion was not a strike, then don’t register a strike but still don’t collect data for a certain amount of time. This way, both the false invalid hit and the false valid hit would be completely ignored by the program."

    "This idea worked with different effectiveness for different wait periods where the data from the IMU was not obtained, but ultimately this approach led to worse results than the previous two. When discussing a different approach to this problem with the course staff, it was suggested to try using a ring buffer and combfilter instead. The ring buffer allowed us to keep track of some of the history of the acceleration data, which seemed important because visually we were able to differentiate between the acceleration data of a valid strike from an invalid strike based on what was happening around the time of the strike, so some system history was necessary to make this differentiation. We made the ring buffer 256 indices long and traversed through the indices with a counter that continued to count beyond 256. This worked because we would take the counter value and mask it with 0xFF, essentially truncating the counter to within the range of 0 to 255, and if the counter ever overflowed, it would just go from 255 back to 0, and the ring buffer would wrap around to the first index. This allowed us to keep a history of the data in an array without having to keep track of where we were in the array, and it also made accessing previous datapoints in the array much easier, which we needed for the combfilter."

    "The combfilter is a type of filter that takes in a signal, in our case an array of the 256 most recent z-acceleration data, and multiplies some of the data points by predefined weights. These new products are then summed together, and this is the output of the combfilter. In order to implement it, the weights all have to sum to zero so that when the data is noisy, the sum of the products will be zero and the combfilter will not have found what it was sifting for. However, if you place the weights at specific data point regions and are careful with how you distribute the weighting, then you can create a filter that creates an output sum that is very high when the data in the filter matches the data that you are interested in registering. For the DigiDrum, this meant building a combfilter that could sift through the past 255 acceleration data points and find when the acceleration pattern matched that of a valid strike motion. In order to determine where in the 256 length array the combfilter’s weights should be, and how positive or negative those weights should be, depended on the data input. After examining the shape of a valid strike and determining an ending point of the strike, where the acceleration went back to its equilibrium value, we were able to look back and determine which features of the strike pattern we wanted to prioritize and give high weighting. The shape that triggers the comb filter to output a large sum of products can be seen in Figure 5. After some tunning, this combfilter was successfully able to register a valid strike and ignore invalid strikes much better than our previous methods, and that is why it was used for the final product."

We confirmed that we were getting stuck in our ISR using two independent observability methods. First, we relied on the VGA visualization that continuously plotted the IMU / complementary-filter signals; when the bug occurred, those plots stopped updating, indicating that we never reached the end of ISR and therefore never semaphored into our VGA protothread. Second, we instrumented the ISR with a dedicated GPIO “scope pin” that was driven high at ISR entry and driven low at ISR exit. Under normal operation, this pin produced a periodic pulse train at the ISR rate. During the failure, the pin became latched high and never returned low, proving the CPU was not exiting the ISR and was therefore stuck in an interrupt-level execution path."

The bug consistently manifested when a hit triggered the DMA stream feeding the DAC via SPI0, but it did not occur when triggering the kick sound on SPI1. This strongly suggested the issue was not simply “DMA start causes lockup,” but rather something specific to the SPI0/DMA interaction, arbitration, or timing. We exhaustively reviewed our DMA configuration and the SPI setup. Despite this, our code appeared to be correct and we were unable to isolate a single root cause in software."

    "Because the hang occurred in the ISR and could prevent the system from recovering naturally, we shifted to a resilience-first mitigation strategy. We added a recovery mechanism by powering the IMUs from GPIO-controlled outputs and enabling I2C timeout logic. The intent was that if an I2C transaction ever failed or stalled (for example, due to the system hanging in an interrupt context), we could detect the error condition and reset the sensor subsystem by power cycling the IMUs, thereby restoring I2C communication and allowing the program to continue without a full reboot. This approach proved effective in practice: after adding GPIO-controlled IMU power and timeout-based detection, the system was able to recover automatically from the original hang scenario and resume operation."

    "Over time, however, the failure mode evolved: instead of presenting purely as a DMA-trigger-related stall, the bug began to manifest more directly as I2C communication failure when a hit was detected. To robustly handle this, we architected the program so that the I2C stack, IMU drivers, and the drum-check IRQ logic ran on core 1, while the remainder of the application (UI, VGA drawing, game logic, and system supervision) ran on core 0. We then implemented a watchdog-style supervisory logic in a protothread on core 0 that monitors for I2C timeout error flags/messages. If core 1 becomes locked due to an I2C failure, core 0 performs a controlled recovery by resetting and relaunching core 1, which reinitializes the I2C peripheral, reconfigures the IRQ/timer infrastructure, and re-applies the IMU power-cycle sequence. With this separation and supervisory restart path, the system gained a reliable self-reset capability: even when the underlying issue appeared, the application could detect it, reset the affected subsystem, and continue operating without requiring manual intervention."

    "Ultimately, we were not able to conclusively identify the root cause of this bug. However, rather than allowing the failure to interrupt gameplay or require a manual reset, we focused on making the system robust against it. By adding automatic detection, power cycling of the IMUs, and the ability for core 0 to reset and relaunch core 1 when a fault was detected, the system could recover transparently during operation. From the user’s perspective, gameplay continued uninterrupted and drum hits remained responsive. The only visible indication that a recovery had occurred was a debugging flag displayed on the VGA output, which we used internally to confirm that these self-resets were happening. In this way, the bug was effectively contained and mitigated without degrading the user experience."
